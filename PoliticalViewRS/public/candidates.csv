He was previously elected to the same position in 2004 and 2010, and had to take a break in the 2016 election cycle for being term-limited under the Constitution.

Revilla ranked 11th in the 2019 race for 12 seats – a winning but dismal performance compared to his previous runs. Running for a national post for the first time in 2004, but carrying the name of his outgoing senator father Ramon Revilla Sr., Bong finished with the second highest number of votes. He topped the race when he ran for reelection in 2010. Among other factors, his much lower ranking in the 2019 senatorial election was attributed by political observers in part to his trial and detention over the misuse of his pork barrel over several years.

In 2013, in the middle of Revilla’s second term as senator, a special audit by the Commission on Audit found that the Priority Development Assistance Fund of about a dozen senators, including Revilla, had been channeled to bogus non-governmental organizations in exchange for kickbacks. Plunder and graft cases were filed only against Revilla and two other opposition senators at the time: Juan Ponce Enrile and Jinggoy Estrada. Revilla was charged for having received P224 million in bribes.

Revilla was detained starting June 2014, and his trial didn’t start until 2017 due to several postponements his camp requested. On December 7, 2018, the Sandiganbayan acquitted him of plunder in a close vote of 3-2, with the majority giving credence to Revilla’s defense that his signature in the transactions was forged. His chief of staff Richard Cambe and alleged mastermind Janet Lim-Napoles were convicted.

This was despite the testimony of a representative of the Anti-Money Laundering Council that a total amount of P87 million in deposits to the bank accounts of Revilla and his family matched the individual amounts and dates listed in the ledger of pork barrel scam whistleblower Benhur Luy, the assistant of Napoles. Revilla also claimed that his wealth came from his earnings as an actor, but these were not reflected in his Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth, which government officials were required to file. The minority who voted to convict Revilla said misuse of funds of that magnitude could not have happened without the knowledge of the senator.

In the 2018 ruling, the Sandiganbayan also ordered the “accused [to] solidarily and jointly” return P124 million to the national treasury. Revilla’s camp has refused to heed the order, saying that his acquittal in the criminal aspect of the case also released him from any civil liability.

In July 2021, already elected back as senator, Revilla was cleared of the 16 remaining graft charges related to the pork barrel scam.

Revilla currently chairs the committee on civil service, government reorganization, and and professional regulation, which explains his bills seeking better benefits or working conditions for government workers. He has also proposed lowering the optional retirement age of government workers from 60 to 56.

He also chairs the public works committee, a position that has been given by Senate leaderships to a Revilla since the time of his father, Ramon Sr. Bong Revilla has chaired this committee in every term he served as senator.

Revilla has followed in his father’s footsteps in both his careers as an actor and a politician. He entered showbusiness in 1983, doing action movies like the ones that made his father popular. He first ran for senator in 2004 when his father’s Senate term was ending. Before this, Revilla served as vice governor (elected 1995), then as governor (elected 1998), of Cavite for one term each, getting special attention and help from President Fidel Ramos’s party, Lakas-NUCD, on both counts. He lost by a considerable margin to Irineo Maliksi when he sought reelection as governor in 2001.

While awaiting the 2004 senatorial election, Revilla was appointed by president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, then his party mate, as chairman of the Videogram Regulatory Board, the precursor of the Optical Media Board.

Revilla is married to actress Lani Mercado (real name: Jesusa Hernandez-Bautista), with whom he has seven children. He has a child with a former girlfriend. His siblings, wife, and children also hold elective positions, making the Revillas the biggest political dynasty in their home province of Cavite to date. He continues to appear in movies and TV series while in public office.

He was formerly with the Philippine National Police (PNP), where he was assigned to the Highway Patrol Group. He also held the position of Public Information Office chief of the PNP Cavite office.

He is the founder of the Riders’ Safety Advocates of the Philippines (RSAP), an organization dedicated to promoting road safety and protecting the rights of motorcycle riders. As part of his advocacy, he runs the YouTube channel “Colonel Bosita, RSAP”.

Bosita gained national attention following an incident in 2021 when he questioned a Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) traffic enforcer’s issuance of a ticket to a motorcycle-riding couple for violating a shoes-only policy. The MMDA accused him of exploiting traffic enforcers for political gain and filed charges of grave coercion and usurpation of authority against him. He was arrested in Surigao del Sur in 2022 but later posted bail.

For the 2022 elections, he partnered with the Bicol-based motorcycle club 1-Rider to participate in the party-list system. He was named the second nominee of the group, which secured two congressional seats, allowing him to enter Congress.

In 2024, Bosita announced his candidacy for the 2025 senatorial elections, citing his partylist’s struggles in passing legislation as a motivating factor for seeking a higher position in government."

She earned a degree in Secondary Education, majoring in Mathematics, from the Philippine Normal University in 1987. In 1996, she completed a master’s degree in Mathematics Education at Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila. She has been involved in activism since her college years, having been a member of the League of Filipino Students.

She was a Mathematics instructor at Quirino High School in Quezon City. While working as a teacher, she became active in the trade union movement, holding various leadership positions within teachers’ organizations. She has been a member of ACT since 1989 and later served as president of the Quezon City Public School Teachers Association. From 2011 to 2012, she was the founding president of ACT-NCR, the largest public sector teachers’ union in the Philippines. She retired from teaching in 2013 to become a full-time organizer for teachers’ unions.

She  first entered Congress in 2016 as ACT’s nominee after the group secured two seats in the partylist elections.

In 2024, the Tagum City Regional Trial Court sentenced her and 12 others to up to six years in prison in connection with the 2018 incident, which they have appealed. That same year, an indigenous peoples’ group filed an ethics complaint against her, calling for her removal from the House of Representatives due to her conviction.

A native of Davao del Sur, Dela Rosa is arguably most well-known for leading the bloody anti-drug campaign of his fellow Davaoeño, former president Rodrigo Duterte. Dela Rosa was then chief of the Philippine National Police, a position he held from July 2016 to April 2018. As PNP chief, Dela Rosa came under fire for human rights violations in the so-called “war on drugs,” which claimed the lives of thousands of Filipinos. He has long-standing ties with Duterte, having served as Davao City police chief when the former president was still mayor.

After Dela Rosa’s mandatory retirement from the PNP, he became director general of the Bureau of Corrections from April to October 2018. He left the BuCor to run for senator in the 2019 elections, where he placed fifth among the 12 winning candidates, with over 19 million votes.

At the Senate, Dela Rosa is pushing for the revival of the death penalty “for those who will import, manufacture, and cultivate illegal drugs”; “substance abuse prevention education for grade school students”; and “strengthening the public health approach” in drug abuse prevention.

Dela Rosa is a member of the Philippine Military Academy’s Sinagtala Class of 1986. He also obtained a master’s degree in public administration from the University of Southeastern Philippines in 1998 and a doctorate in development administration from the same university in 2006.

He earned his bachelor’s degree in marketing from Ateneo de Davao University.

Go is known as the executive assistant of Rodrigo Duterte, having served the former president since 1998, when Duterte was still the representative of the 1st District of Davao City. Go became special assistant to the president in 2016, after Duterte rose to the presidency.

Go won a Senate seat in 2019, ranking third place in a race won by mostly Duterte allies. But even as senator, Go did not stop being Duterte’s constant companion in the last years of his presidency. The former president even mentioned Go and his pet bills during his 2019 State of the Nation Address – Go’s first SONA as senator.

Before his Senate stint, a Rappler investigation found Go to have intervened in the multibillion-peso project to acquire two brand new frigates or warships for the Philippine Navy. He denied intervening in the project, which became a subject of congressional hearings in 2018.

In 2021, or just over two years after he was elected, the neophyte senator filed to run as vice president. He withdrew that candidacy when Duterte’s daughter Sara announced she was running for vice president. Go would file to run for president, only to announce his withdrawal from the race a few weeks after.

Go was author of several laws that Duterte signed into law, including the Malasakit Center Act and the Department of Migrant Workers Act. He currently chairs the committees on sports and health and demography.

While he has chaired the games and amusement and tourism committees at various points during these terms, pushing for sports development at the grassroots level, Lapid is primarily credited as a co-author (with Senator Francis Escudero) of the Free Legal Assistance Act of 2010. The grants tax deductions to lawyers and law firms that give pro bono services to the indigent.

Lapid is not known to participate in debates or speak during Senate sessions because of his acknowledged limitations in communicating in English. He had earlier moved for major communication in the chamber to be translated into Filipino, but there has been no known policy that resulted from it.

His earlier bills had been ridiculed as “bizarre” by some quarters and as “insightful and sensitive” by others. These included the proposals – which didn’t progress into laws – to provide appropriate school desks for left-handed students and to limit the weight of school bags. He had explained that while he didn’t go to college, he wanted to look after the health and welfare of students that way.

Lapid stopped with his studies after high school to pursue a career in film. He started as a stuntman in the late 1960s, following the popularity of his uncle, action star Jess Lapid. Using the screen name Lito Lapid, he eventually became a main actor himself, with several high-grossing movies to his credit until 2001, which means he was making movies while serving as vice governor (1992-1995) and governor (1995-2004) of Pampanga.

When he reached his term limit as senator in 2016, Lapid, whose hometown was Porac, ran for mayor of Angeles City in Pampanga, and lost heavily to the long-time mayor, Edgardo Pamintuan.

In 2019, he made a fresh bid for a Senate seat, riding on the popularity of TV series where he had played a major role, FPJ’s Ang Probinsiyano. As senator, he still appears in another series, FPJ’s Batang Quiapo. FPJ is the initial for the late king of Philippine movies, Fernando Poe Jr., who himself ran for president in 2004 but lost, allegedly due to massive cheating, to president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, Lapid’s province mate who convinced her to run for senator that year.

Lapid is married to Marissa Tadeo, mother of his four children, including Mark, who succeeded him as Pampanga governor in 2004. Lapid has two more children with other women, whom he met in show business."

She pursued a bachelor’s degree in Journalism at the University of the Philippines Diliman. As a student activist and leader, she served as president of the Union of Journalists of the Philippines (UJP) and was elected chairperson of the College of Mass Communication Student Council in 1994. The following year, she became the national chairperson of the National Union of Students of the Philippines. She also actively participated in campaigns led by progressive national organizations, including Kilusang Mayo Uno, Karapatan, and the National Federation of Sugar Workers.

Her early years were marked by repeated evacuations due to armed conflict in Mindanao. Following the declaration of Martial Law across the Philippines by the Marcos administration, her family was forced to relocate to Manila. During the Estrada administration, while visiting her grandmother in Maguindanao, the government launched an “All-Out War” against the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, ordering military attacks on Camp Abubakar, which was near her ancestral home. This offensive once again forced her family to flee. This led her to collaborate with organizations such as Bagong Alyansang Makabayan and the National Council of Churches in the Philippines to mobilize support for displaced Moros and advocate for an end to the conflict.

In addition to advocating for Moro rights, Lidasan has been an outspoken critic of militarization and U.S. imperialism, highlighting issues such as displacement and land-grabbing.

In the 2004 elections, she was named as the first nominee of the Suara Bangsamoro partylist in the 2004 elections, and third nominee of Bayan Muna partylist in the 2022 elections. She failed to secure a congressional seat on both occasions. She was announced as the 11th candidate of Makabayan coalition for the 2025 senatorial elections."

He first represented the Alagad group from 2004 to 2013, and later the Social Amelioration and Genuine Intervention on Poverty (SAGIP) organization from 2016 to 2025. He was also appointed deputy speaker of the House of Representatives from 2019 to 2022. 

Marcoleta is known for his conservative views and his involvement in controversial legislative actions, including proposing a P1,000 annual budget for the Commission on Human Rights in 2017 and opposing the franchise renewal of ABS-CBN Corporation in 2020. In 2021, alongside fellow party-list representative Mike Defensor, he spearheaded the distribution of the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin as treatment for COVID-19, despite warnings from the World Health Organization and the Department of Health regarding its unproven efficacy.

He also faced criticism for his controversial remarks, including a statement claiming that there is no West Philippine Sea. This led to accusations of him being pro-China. In 2024, he accused Commission on Elections Chairperson George Garcia of maintaining offshore bank accounts, prompting Garcia to consider (but eventually forgo) filing an ethics complaint against him. 

Marcoleta initially ran for the Senate in 2022 under the UniTeam alliance of Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte, but withdrew his candidacy shortly before election day, reportedly to avoid the one-year appointment ban on losing candidates. He filed his candidacy again for the 2025 senatorial elections.

He holds a law degree from San Sebastian College-Recoletos, a master’s degree in business administration from the University of the East, and a doctorate in public administration from the University of the Philippines. He completed short-term studies in developmental leadership at Harvard Kennedy School.

He is affiliated with the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP–Laban), and is regarded as a political ally of former president Rodrigo Duterte and his family."

She also claimed to have graduated from University of the Philippines (UP) College of Law and Asian Institute of Management (AIM). UP, however, said it had no records of Marcos graduating, while AIM said it never offered the degree she claimed to have earned.

Marcos is the daughter of dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos and Imelda Marcos, and sister of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.

Her career in politics started in 1975, when she chaired Kabataang Barangay. She also served as one of the two assemblyman to the Regular Batasang Pambansa for Ilocos Norte from 1984 to 1986, when the unicameral legislature was abolished in the aftermath of the EDSA People Power Revolution. Her family was later exiled to Hawaii.

In 1991, the District Court of Honolulu, Hawaii, found Marcos civilly liable for the “wrongful death” of student Archimedes Trajano. But the Philippine Supreme Court in 2006 did not enforce the payment because of failure to serve summons.

Twelve years after their exile, Marcos returned to politics and ran as representative of the 2nd District of Ilocos Norte in 1998. She held the position for three consecutive terms until 2007. Three years later, she was elected governor of Ilocos Norte and held the position for three consecutive terms until 2019. Marcos then ran for senator in the 2019 elections, winning the race at eight place.

Aside from questions about her educational background, the senator is also marred with a myriad of controversies: in 2013, she was found to be a beneficiary of a secret offshore trust; in 2017, a Rappler report said Ilocos Norte’s share of the tobacco excise tax was used to fund the Marcos’ pet projects as governor for at least two years; in 2018, Sandiganbayan records showed she and her brother Bongbong were beneficiaries of the Swiss foundations earlier found by the anti-graft court as illegally created and maintained.

Marcos currently chairs four Senate panels: committee on cooperatives, committee on electoral reforms and people’s participation, committee on foreign relations, and committee on social justice, welfare and rural development."

Marquez has sought a seat in the Philippine Senate in multiple elections. In both the 2019 and 2022 elections, he filed his candidacy for senator, but the Commission on Elections declared him a nuisance candidate, citing his lack of national recognition and insufficient financial resources to sustain a nationwide campaign. He challenged both rulings before the Supreme Court, which ruled in his favor on both occasions. Although his candidacy was ultimately rendered moot due to the conclusion of both elections, the Supreme Court deemed it necessary to address the issue, recognizing the possibility of similar circumstances arising in future elections.

He was a member of the leftist student group Samahang Demokratiko ng Kabataan until he attended the Philippine Military Academy, graduating in 1979. He later earned a master’s degree in Defense Studies from the University of Canberra in Australia.

He was active in various military operations, including the communist rebellion and the Moro conflict. In 1989, then Captain Querubin co-founded the Young Officers’ Union, which along with other groups such as the Soldiers of the Filipino People and Reform the Armed Forces Movement participated in the most serious coup against Corazon Aquino’s government. He and his co-coup plotters were detained but were granted amnesty by President Fidel Ramos.

In 1994, he was credited with the neutralization of Barahama Sali, which led to the eventual release from captivity of Catholic priest Fr. Cirilo Nacorda who had been kidnapped by the Abu Sayyaf in Basilan. He was also involved in the 2002 operation that killed the terrorist kidnap group Abu Sayyaf leader Abu Sabaya. Throughout his military career, he has received awards including the Medal of Valor, the highest Philippines military honor, the Most Distinguished Conduct Star, three Distinguished Service Stars, seven Gold Cross Medals, and 12 military merit medals.

In 2006, he was implicated in an alleged plot to overthrow the government of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, leading to his detention. He was later granted amnesty and released.

He resigned from military service and ran for a Senate seat under the Nacionalista Party in the 2010 elections but was unsuccessful. He supported the 2016 presidential candidacy of Senator Grace Poe, who had pledged to appoint him as anti-crime czar if she were elected. He later announced his intention to run for the Senate again in the 2025 elections."

He began his career in the entertainment industry as a drummer before transitioning into acting, often portraying the comedic sidekick to leading stars in films. He later became a co-host of several noontime television programs before being given the opportunity to headline Wowowee in 2005.

As a television host, Revillame has been known for his on-air outbursts, including reprimanding staff members and co-hosts during live broadcasts. His career has been marked by several controversies, such as the 2006 PhilSports Stadium stampede during an anniversary show of Wowowee, allegations of game show rigging in 2007, and his 2009 remarks criticizing the simultaneous airing of the funeral possession of former president Corazon Aquino and his show. He was also involved in a legal dispute concerning his contract with ABS-CBN and has been scrutinized by the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board for segments deemed inappropriate.

As an entrepreneur, he co-developed Wil Tower, a condominium project, in partnership with former senator Manny Villar. He has also owned and operated restaurants in Quezon City.

Revillame has been approached multiple times to run for public office. In 2010, then-president Rodrigo Duterte encouraged him to seek a Senate seat, but he declined, citing his commitment to his entertainment career. In 2021, he again dismissed the possibility of running in the 2022 elections, emphasizing his lack of experience in lawmaking.

In 2024, he formally filed his candidacy for the 2025 senatorial election as an independent candidate.

He resigned after he was allegedly found wanting in fully and promptly informing the President of matters that needed urgent attention. Among these was importation of 300,000 metric tons of sugar in the face of an impending shortage.

In announcing his resignation via social media post, Rodriguez said he wanted to spend more time with his young family, but that he was transitioning to become the President’s chief of staff. A draft administrative order giving him enormous powers as COS was censured by Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Juan Ponce Enrile. Rodriguez then completely exited the Marcos administration and was replaced by former Supreme Court Chief Justice Lucas Bersamin.

Two months later, Rodriguez was also kicked out of the President’s party, the Partido Federal, where he was executive vice president. Party leaders cited, among other reasons, his failure to get party mates appointed in the Marcos administration. In January 2024, he joined a forum preceding a rally organized by the camp of former president Rodrigo Duterte in Davao City, where he criticized the constitutional change initiatives of the administration and insinuated that the attendees at the simultaneous pro-Marcos rally in Manila were paid.

Rodriguez earned his law degree from the University of Santo Tomas, establishing private practice later on. He served as barangay (village) councilor and then later longtime chairman of Sacred Heart, Quezon City, before he was appointed by then-mayor Feliciano Belmonte Jr. to various offices in the local government.

Tolentino, however, was not a greenhorn in campaigns and elections. His father, Isaac Tolentino, served as mayor of Tagaytay City for 26 year – the longest in that post – from 1954 to 1980. In 1986, newly installed president Corazon Aquino appointed Francis OIC mayor of Tagaytay. Eleven years later, in 1995, he was elected mayor, and reelected twice to serve the maximum allowed terms until 2004.

He did not return to local politics anymore, as his brother Bambol (full name: Abraham Tolentino) took over as mayor in 2004 and had been alternating with his wife in the position since. The Tolentinos are the second largest political dynasty in Cavite, as of the 2022 elections.

In 2010, Francis Tolentino was named chairman of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority by president Benigno Aquino III. He was the first non-Manileño to have held the post. He served until 2015, resigning to prepare for his first senatorial campaign.

During Tolentino’s time at the MMDA, the agency introduced the integrated bus terminal concept, which prohibited buses coming from his home province of Cavite from plying beyond the end of the Coastal Road in Parañaque City. A commuters’ group protested the policy, citing how it would inconvenience commuters who would have additional stops – therefore, additional cost and time – getting to their destinations. At the time, there were no connecting rides from the terminal to the city centers. This Southwest Interim Transport Terminal became the forerunner of the Parañaque Integrated Terminal Exchange, a transport terminal servicing several provinces and a commercial center.

It was also during Tolentino’s time when the MMDA started providing real-time traffic updates via social media, and relaunched the Pasig River Ferry to ease traffic congestion in the National Capital Region.

While he was initially considered by the Liberal Party as one of its senatorial candidates for 2016, Tolentino was dropped from the ticket after a 2015 incident, where he was alleged to have brought a girl group, which did a lewd performance at a political event of his party mate in Laguna province. He denied this, and said he was just a guest. A 2013 social media post by the group, however, indicated a connection with Tolentino – they thanked him for getting their services for his brother Abraham’s campaign.

Tolentino lost in the 2016 election, placing 13th. He accused the 12th winning candidate, Leila de Lima, of cheating her of the seat, and pursued a protest with the Senate Electoral Tribunal for two years, while he was serving as then-president Rodrigo Duterte’s political affairs adviser. He withdrew the protest in 2018 so he could focus on preparing for this 2019 senatorial bid, which he would eventually win.

He currently serves as Senate majority floor leader, and chairs the committee on ethics and privileges and the committee on rules. Previously, before the leadership changes in the chamber, he chaired the committee on justice and human rights and the blue ribbon committee.

In the 18th Congress, in recognition of his experience as longtime mayor and as MMDA chief, he was named chairperson of the Senate committee on local government and of the committee on urban planning, housing, and resettlement.

Tolentino is a law graduate of the Ateneo de Manila University, and has earned three masterals in law from universities in the United States and the United Kingdom. An Armed Forces of the Philippines reservist, he also holds a master’s degree in national security administration from the National Defense College of the Philippines.

He is not married, but has a son that sits as the No. 1 councilor of Tagaytay City."

He earned his bachelor’s degree in business administration from the University of the East. Tulfo is a known broadcaster and news anchor. The Tulfo brothers – Erwin, together with his brothers Ramon, Ben, and Raffy – are an established brand in Philippine media, with a solid base of followers for their public service programs.

Years before his DSWD stint, Erwin made headlines in 2019 after he called his predecessor, then DSWD secretary Rolando Bautista, “buang” (crazy) on his radio program when the latter was unavailable to be interviewed. Tulfo later apologized to Bautista.

At the start of his term, Tulfo wanted to extend the contracts of DSWD employees nationwide who were under the cost of service employment. He also wanted to streamline services for Filipinos seeking the department's assistance.

But Tulfo held the DSWD post for only six months; he was bypassed twice by the Commission on Appointments over his US citizenship and a libel conviction. Months after leaving the Marcos Cabinet, he joined the 19th Congress and became a congressman as a substitute nominee for party-list group ACT-CIS.
