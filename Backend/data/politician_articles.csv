Benhur Abalos,Abalos: Let NFA buy and sell rice again to help farmers,1-Apr-25,https://politiko.com.ph/2025/04/01/abalos-let-nfa-buy-and-sell-rice-again-to-help-farmers/politiko-lokal/,"Alyansa para sa Bagong Pilipinas senatorial candidate Benhur Abalos is pushing for the amendment of the Rice Tariffication Law (RTL) to strengthen the National Food Authority (NFA) to safeguard local farmers and stabilize rice prices.

Abalos said the shortcomings of the RTL have become evident over time. He said the Senate and the House of Representatives need to conduct a thorough review of the law and make the necessary changes.

He noted that the RTL, introduced in 2019 and amended in 2024, was meant to lower rice prices and liberalize imports but has exposed significant flaws that demand congressional action.

Abalos said the law stripped the NFA of its authority to manage rice importation and limited its role to maintaining rice stocks for emergencies and calamities, weakening the government?s capacity to stabilize prices and protect local farmers from unfair competition and market manipulation.

He proposed providing NFA with sufficient funding and logistical support, including trucks that can be deployed to purchase rice directly from farmers and sell it at fair prices.

?Isipin lang natin ito, kung ang NFA magkaroon ng tamang pondo, malaking pondo, at bibilhin niya lahat ng mga bigas ng ating mga magsasaka sa tamang presyo na hindi malulugi. At ibebenta ito sa publiko ng tamang presyo at umiikot ang perang ito. Talaga maaalalayan natin ang ating mga magsasaka,? he explained.

?Kasi ang nangyayari ngayon ang binibili nila, hindi nila ibibenta, naka-stock lang. At ito ang binibigay during baha, calamity or earthquake. Kaya sayang ang kapangyarihan na yan ng NFA na makatulong sa ating mga magsasaka,? added Abalos, a former Secretary of the Department of the Interior and Local Government.

If elected to the Senate, Abalos vowed to file and support legislation that would amend the RTL, restore the buying and selling authority of the NFA, and establish mechanisms to ensure rice price stability and long-term food security for the nation.

?That?s the problem I see, and the solution I see to help our farmers is to amend the Rice Tariffication Law,? Abalos stressed."
Jerome Adonis,Migrante International supports trade union leader Jerome Adonis for Senate!,14-Aug-24,https://migranteinternational.org/migrante-supports-jerome-adonis-for-senate/,"Migrante International and its member overseas Filipino organizations are proud to support trade union leader Jerome Adonis in his upcoming Senate bid. As the Secretary General of Kilusang Mayo Uno and a veteran labor rights advocate, Adonis is tireless in fighting for the rights of workers and the common people.
Jerome Adonis has a strong record of supporting OFWs and everyday Filipinos. On the streets and in factories, he serves as an advocate for the millions of workers who are forced to work dirty, dangerous, and demeaning jobs both at home and abroad. Migrant workers have for years worked with Adonis to campaign for living wages, job security, and dignified work. His leadership in working class struggles resonate with many OFWs who are forced abroad by poor economic conditions only to find exploitative and contractual work in other countries. We are confident that Jerome will bring the cause of OFWs into the Senate as a true representative of Filipino workers everywhere.
As a leader for genuine and anti-imperialist trade unionism, Adonis is part of the cause of international working class solidarity. He serves as a Philippine representative to the International Trade Union Confederation. Jerome is also the Second Deputy Secretary to the International League of Peoples? Struggle. In global conferences, Adonis advocates for collective workers? struggles against foreign monopoly capital. He bridges the struggle of refugees of countries like Palestine to the Filipino working class. He fights not only for the rights of Filipino workers and migrants, but all migrants and workers of the world.
Today, Jerome Adonis and the Makabayan Coalition represent a genuine opposition to the country?s broken political and economic order. Committed leaders like France Castro, Arlene Brosas, and Jerome Adonis represent our people?s aspirations to break free from poverty and hunger. Our movement of overseas Filipinos overseas is determined to bring this truly people?s alternative into the Senate and beyond.
Manggagawa, progresibo, para sa migranteng Pilipino. Dalhin si Jerome Adonis sa Senado! #AdonisSaSenado"

Sabi nga nila, ang mga manggagawa ang nagsisilbing instrumento para matugunan ang iba?t ibang pangangailangan ng bawa?t indibidwal.
Gaya na lamang sa ating bansa, kung saan ? ang bawa?t mga manggagawa ang may malaking gampanin pagdating sa mga serbisyo kahit saan mang establishimento. Gaya na lamang ng mall, hospital, paaralan at iba pang industriya.
Kung kaya?t ganito na lamang din ang pagsulong at panawagan ng iba?t ibang sektor sa pagsigaw ng kanilang karapatan.
Sa ating bansa, isa si Sir Jerome Adonis, ang Secretary General ng Kilusang Mayo Uno sa mga patuloy na nagbibigay boses sa mga manggagawang lumalaban ng patas ngunit nanantiling salat pa rin at nalulugmok sa hirap.
Ayon kay Adonis, nagsimula ito sa iba?t ibang uri ng trabaho na siyang nagpamulat sa kaniya sa realidad ng sitwasyon sa labor sector.
Aniya, bagama?t hindi ito sanay na mamuno sa isang organisasyon, ay nilakasan pa rin nito ang kaniyang loob para magbigay ng lakas ng loob sa mga mangagagawang nangangailanagn ng boses para mapakinggan ng pamahalaan.
Isa naman aniya sa pinaka-satisfying na parte sa kaniyang tungkulin ay sa kabila ng mga pagbabanta at panggigipit na nararanasan ng kanilang organisasyon, ay masaya parin siya tuwing nakikita na nananatili matibay ang pundasyon sa pakikipaglaban ng mga manggagawa
Sa kabila naman ng hirap at dagok sa kaniyang trabaho bilang Secretary General, pinanghahawakan niya ang patuloy na nakikitang mga kakulangan sa pagbibigay ng nararapat sa mga manggagawa sa bansa."

Castro highlighted the need for the upper chamber to have ?genuine representatives of marginalized sectors.?
Voice of workers

According to the lawmaker, Adonis? platform focuses on living wages, workers? rights, and national industrialization, which she said are ?crucial issues that need to be addressed if we are to achieve genuine progress and development for our country.?
Brosas echoed this, saying Adonis? platform ?focuses on living wages, workers? rights, food security, new politics versus corrupt governance, and the defense of Philippine sovereignty against foreign aggression, [which] resonates deeply with the struggles of Filipino workers and other marginalized sectors.?
She also worked with Adonis to craft pro-worker legislation such as House Bill 7568 or the P750 across-the-board wage hike bill.
Both lawmakers called progressive and democratic forces to rally behind Adonis? candidacy and ensure that the ?voice of workers and the marginalized sectors will be heard in the 2025 polls.?"

Amad stated that he always pushes for interreligious dialogue.

?Walang separate peace for Muslims. Walang separate peace for the Lumad. Walang separate peace for Christians. Both groups should work together para sa katahimikan,? he said in an interview with Emmanuel Baylosis on KananPH on Saturday.

(There is no separate peace for Muslims. There is no separate peace for the Lumad. There is no separate peace for Christians. Both groups should work together for peace.)

Amad said interreligious dialogue means religious groups helping each other and adapting collective stances against injustice.

We should find what are the unifying aspects in the humanity of both the Lumad, the Muslim, and the Christians in Mindanao,? he said.

Former Senator Francis Pangilinan, in a statement, said he supports moves in the House of Representatives to combat fake news.

?Mahalaga ang pagdinig na ito upang labanan ang disimpormasyon?hindi lang tuwing halalan kundi sa araw-araw nating talakayan,? he said.

(This hearing is important in our fight against disinformation?not just during elections, but for everyday discussions.)

He said that he previously pushed for stiff penalties for spreading fake news on social media platforms during his tenure as a senator in 2022.

?Dapat managot ang social media platforms at advertisers?walang puwang ang kasinungalingan sa demokrasya,? he added.

Bunyog Partylist senatorial bet David D?Angelo took to social media to claim that removing tax on oil will not bring down electricity prices.

?Kapag inalis mo ang buwis na kabuuan sa petrolyo, ang makikinabang dyan ay mga oil companies at ang fossil fuel industry na nagpapalala sa climate change at sumisira sa kalikasan,? D?Angelo stated.

(If you remove the entire tax on petroleum, the only ones who will benefit from it are the oil companies and fossil fuel industry that are worsening climate change and destroying nature.)

Among his proposed solutions are the removal of the Value-Added Tax (VAT) for residential consumers, the removal of system loss penalties for residential consumers, reforms within electric cooperatives, and EPIRA reforms.

?Commercial users can pay for the electricity as is, since may kita naman sila. Ang unang dapat bigyan ng relief ay mga residential consumers? (Commercial users can pay for the electricity as is, since they have income. The first ones who should be provided with relief are the residential consumers?) Taxes are needed by the government, so let's not remove it totally; just remove the burden from the sector that is burdened by the tax. Hindi natin dapat alisin ang tax sa langis o petrolyo kundi sa bill sa kuryente (We should not remove tax from oil or petroleum, but from the electricity bills),? he added.

He also said that tax should either be removed or suspended for operators of public utility vehicles.

Ariel Querubin joined a farmers? rally on Saturday and called for a crackdown on rice smugglers and hoarders.

He stated that the government?s rice importation policies were forcing farmers to lower their prices to disadvantageous amounts as low as P14 per kilo for locally grown palay.

?Nag-iimport tayo ng bigas. Tapos mas mura nilang binebenta kaysa dun sa nasaka natin, yung binebenta natin. Kawawa talaga yung mga lokal nating magsasaka kasi binabarat sila,? he said.

(We are importing rice. Then it will be sold cheaper than what is harvested and sold in the country. Our local farmers are pitiful because they are being lowballed.)

Querubin said that the government should be mandated to prioritize the purchase of local products instead of imported produce.

?Ipupush din natin na lahat ng agencies ng gobyerno na unahin muna na bilhin yung mga produkto ng ating magsasaka kaysa naman yung imported,? he said.

(We will push all agencies of the government to buy the products of our farmers instead of the imported ones.)

?Ang daming mga imbestigasyon na nangyayari sa Senado, sa Kongreso. Pero mayroon na ba tayong napakulong na smugglers, mga hoarders na yan? ... Hanggang ngayon?kapag may nabangga na sila na malaking pangalan ay naduduwag naman na sila. Kaya ang kailangan natin ay isang matapang na senador,? he added.

Wilson Amad,SC finds COMELEC guilty of contempt in VP aspirant Amad case,24-Nov-22,https://politiko.com.ph/2022/11/24/sc-finds-comelec-guilty-of-contempt-in-vp-aspirant-amad-case/politiko-lokal/,"The Supreme Court (SC) has found the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) guilty of contempt for failing to implement its halt order against declaring a vice presidential aspirant as a nuisance candidate for the 2022 elections.
In an 18-page decision, the SC said that it issued a TRO dated Jan. 20 that ordered the poll body to include in the ballots the name of vice presidential candidate Wilson Caritero Amad but ?it is undisputed that the COMELEC did not comply with such directive, considering that, as explained by the COMELEC, several pre-election activities had already commenced even before the issuance of the TRO.?
Because of this, the SC ruled that ?the Court also finds it proper to cite the members of the COMELEC in contempt for violation of the TRO, and to impose the penalty of severe reprimand.?
?On this note, however, the Court recognizes that the composition of the COMELEC has changed since the issuance of the TRO and its consequent violation,? the SC noted.
?As such, the Court clarifies that the resolution of this case only affects the COMELEC and its membership who were the ones directly responsible for the TRO?s violation,? it added.
Since Amad challenged in his petition to the SC the COMELEC rulings that declared him a nuisance candidate, the SC also declared his petition as moot and academic since the 2022 national elections are already over.
The COMELEC First Division issued a Dec. 15, 2021 resolution that declared Amad a nuisance candidate that was affirmed by the COMELEC en banc in a Dec. 20, 2021 ruling.
The COMELEC en banc later issued a Jan.3 resolution that turned down Amad?s motion for reconsideration for failure to be filed on time.
?With regard to the COMELEC?s ruling that Amad?s motion for reconsideration was defective and filed out of time, a plain review of the records reveal otherwise,? the SC said.
The SC pointed out, as shown by the evidence presented by Amad, that ?contrary to ruling of the COMELEC, the same was not belatedly filed.?
Because of this, the SC issued a TRO on Jan. 20 against the COMELEC rulings.
However, the COMELEC informed the SC in its comments that the generation of the final ballot face templates were done on Jan. 9 and the subsequent generation of the serialized machine-readable official ballots on Jan. 15.
The COMELEC later informed the SC that the poll body has commenced the configuration of the secure digital cards for the vote-counting machines that started Jan. 23.
In the same decision, the SC also told the COMELEC that poll body erred in declaring Amad a nuisance candidate.
?Relevantly, as pointed out by Amad in the instant petition, the Constitution only prescribes age, citizenship, voting and residence qualifications to be able to run for Vice President. Clearly, being known throughout the Philippines and having an established network nationwide are not qualifications for Vice President. In fact, the lack thereof are not even grounds to be declared as a nuisance candidate in accordance with the Omnibus Election Code,? it ruled."

The SC granted the petition of Amad who assailed the Dec. 13 resolution of the COMELEC and the poll body?s Jan. 3 order that denied his motion for reconsideration.
In the TRO issued Jan. 20, the SC directed the COMELEC ?to comment on the petition within a non-extendible period of ten (10) days from notice hereof.?
?Meanwhile, a temporary restraining order is issued, effectively immediately and continuing until further orders from this Court, enjoining You, respondent COMELEC, your agents, representatives, or persons acting in your place or stead, from enforcing the assailed Resolution dated December 13, 2021 and Order dated January 3, 2022 in SPA No. 21-057 (DC)(MP),? it said.
The SC noted the Dec. 13 COMELEC resolution declared Amad a nuisance candidate and canceled his certificate of candidacy (COC) for vice-president.
The Jan. 4 COMELEC order denied his motion for reconsideration for being defective and for being filed out of time."
Wilson Amad,VP aspirant gets halt order vs Comelec order declaring him as nuisance bet,20-Jan-22,https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/01/20/2155230/vp-aspirant-gets-halt-order-vs-comelec-order-declaring-him-nuisance-bet,"MANILA, Philippines ? The Supreme Court has stopped the Commission on Elections from implementing its order declaring vice presidential aspirant Wilson Caritero Amad as a nuisance candidate for the 2022 elections.
The SC en banc issued a temporary restraining order against the Comelec enjoining it from enforcing its resolution dated December 13 that declared Amad as a nuisance candidate and cancelled his Certificate of Candidacy for vice president.
The high court also enjoined the Comelec from enforcing its order that threw out Amad?s motion for reconsideration for ?being defective and for being filed out of time.?
The Comelec was given a non-extendible period of 10 days from notice of the en banc order to file its comment.
On Wednesday, senatorial aspirant Norman Cordero Marquez also secured the same relief from the SC. Like Amad, Marquez was also declared as a nuisance candidate.
It is unclear how this will affect the Comelec?s printing of official ballots for the 2022 polls.
Earlier this week, Comelec director Lai David said that the final ballot face, which contains the list of the final candidates, is already ready.
Printing of the ballots may ?tentatively? start on January 20.
But Comelec spokesperson James Jimenez also admitted that ?the printing committee, taking into consideration various technical factors, has moved the start of printing to a date yet to be announced.?
?The committee assures the public that this later start will not negatively impact the Comelec?s preparations for the elections,? he added.
Jimenez has yet to reply to reporters? questions if the names of Amad and Marquez will be added to the ballots. "

The Supreme Court (SC) has found the Commission on Elections (Comelec) guilty of contempt for failure to implement a restraining order, directing the poll body to include the name of Wilson Caritero Amad in the printing of ballots as a candidate for vice president in the May 2022 general elections.
?Nevertheless, the members of the Commission on Elections are found guilty of contempt of the Supreme Court for their disobedience to the Court?s lawful directive, specifically the Temporary Restraining Order dated January 20, 2022,? the SC said in an 18-page decision signed by Associate Justice Samuel Gaerlan.
?Accordingly, they are reprimanded for this disobedience,? it added.
Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo concurred with the decision along with Associate Justices Marvic Leonen, Alfredo Benjamin Caguioa, Ramon Paul Hernando, Amy Lazaro-Javier, Rodil Zalameda, Mario Lopez, Ricardo Rosario, Jhosep Lopez, Japar Dimaampao, Jose Midas Marquez and Maria Filomena Singh.
Associate Justices Henri Jean Paul Inting and Antoni Kho Jr. did not take part in the decision, which was promulgated on July 5, 2022 and made public on Nov. 22.
Comelec Chairman George Garcia said in a Viber message that they ?thank the SC? for its guidance, emphasizing that similar incidents will not happen in the future while ?proper and timely scheduling of activities and sufficient info campaign will be ensured.?
Prior to this, Amad filed his certificate of candidacy for vice president but was declared by Comelec as a ?nuisance candidate.?
Amad filed his motion for reconsideration before the Comelec on Dec. 20, 2021 that was eventually denied by the poll body on Jan. 3, 2022, prompting him to file a petition on Jan. 4, 2022 asking the SC to issue a temporary restraining order against the Comelec?s decision as it committed ?abuse of discretion.?
The SC then issued a TRO on Jan. 20, 2022 and directed the Comelec to include Amad?s name in official ballots for the May 9 polls, but was not implemented by the poll body, saying that it already started its preparations for ballot printing before the restraining order came out.
?Notably, without considering Amad?s statutory right to challenge the Comelec?s disposition, the Comelec proceeded with its pre-election activities, and even commenced the printing of the serialized ballots without Amad?s name on Jan. 23, 2022 after the court?s issuance of the TRO,? the SC said.

It fielded former Bayan Muna Rep. Satur Ocampo and former Bayan Muna and Gabriela Rep. Maza in 2010.
Former Bayan Muna Rep. CasiÒo was its lone candidate in 2013 while former Bayan Muna Rep. Neri Colmenares  was its champion in 2016 and 2019.
In the 2022 national elections, its candidates were Colmenares and KMU chairperson Bong Labog.
Makabayan?s 10 candidates is the biggest slate progressive parties have fielded in any election for the Senate in history.
The PnB in 1987 had seven organic and two guest candidates in the first ever elections for the Senate after the fall of the Ferdinand Marcos Jr. dictatorship the year previous.
Labor leader Crispin Beltran, press freedom icon Jose Burgos Jr., New People?s Army co-founder Bernabe Buscayno, top notch human rights lawyer Romeo Capulong, former political detainee Horacio Morales, women?s rights activist Nelia Sancho, and peasant leader Jaime Tadeo were the progressives? candidates.
Labor lawyer Augusto Sanchez and Wigberto TaÒada were guest candidates. Sanchez lost but TaÒada, also an administration candidate, won.
Last July, Makabayan said it planned on fielding a full slate in the May 2025 elections.
?Our primary consideration is whether they can present a comprehensive platform that would respond to the interest of the people. The track record of Makabayan shows consistent representation in the fight for decent wage, genuine land reform, and national sovereignty,? Makabayan executive vice president and former ACT Teachers? Party Rep. Antonio Tinio said. # (Raymund B. Villanueva)"
Nars Alyn Andamo,"Alyn Andamo aims to renationalize PH healthcare system for improved wage, benefits",11-Mar-25,https://dzrh.com.ph/post/bakitikaw-alyn-andamo-aims-to-renationalize-ph-healthcare-system-for-improved-wage-benefits,"Senatorial candidate Alyn Andamo aims to renationalize the Philippine healthcare system to ensure improved wages and benefits for local healthcare workers.
During the Bakit Ikaw: The DZRH Job Interview on Tuesday, March 11, Andamo emphasized that as a nurse, she will focus on advocating for healthcare and fighting for the rights of healthcare workers.
?Alam po natin na halos naghihingalo na po ang kalagayan sa sitwasyong pangkalusugan at yung healthcare system natin kailangan meron na po tayong agarang solusyon na gawin dahil napaka seryoso ng mga health problems natin na kinakaharap ng ating mga kababayan,? she said.
Andamo addressed the sight of patients lining up at public hospitals before dawn, to make it to the cut-off for the day. She continued, stating how patients crowd emergency rooms, specifically outpatient departments in public hospitals.
?Napaka-mahal po ng ating mga gamot, yung pagpapagamot, at yung pagpapa-ospital. Kaya gusto natin ng mas matinding pagbabago dito, seryosong problema kaya seryosong solusyon po ang gusto natin,? she added.
?Dapat mayroon tayong libre, sapat, kumpleto po, at dekalidad na serbisyong pangkalusugan sa lahat po ng ating public hospital,? she continued.
?Libreng gamot at libreng pagamot?
To ensure an improved healthcare system, Andamo stated the government needs to prioritize healthcare, highlighting the importance of proper budget allocation for the sector. Andamo stressed that the allocated budget for healthcare should not be below P30 billion.
?Ibig sabihin po lampas one trillion pesos. Para yung mga pangangailangan ng ating mga kababayan na libreng gamot, libreng papa-ospital, na hindi na kailangan pag-dating nila sa emergency room ng public hospital tatanungin kung meron silang card ng PhilHealth or naka-rehistro ba sila sa Konsulta package,? she emphasized.
?Basta Pilipino ka, dapat mayroon kang libreng gamot, libreng pagpapagamot sa kahit na anong sulok ng bansa po hanggang baryo po yung ating pinapangarap dyan na hindi po-probemahin ng ating bayan pag nagkasakit po,? she added.
To ensure this, Andamo mentioned barangay health stations are a must in all barangays so that every Filipino has access to proper healthcare.
Addressing the healthcare workers? woes
Andamo stressed the government should also prioritize healthcare workers, adding that the lack of health practitioners in hospitals contributes to the challenges the latter face.
Aside from hospitals being understaffed, Andamo said several are also contractual workers.
?Ibig sabihin mga job order nurses. After three months, six months, wala na ulit silang trabaho. So paano natin mahihikayat na manatili sa ating bansa kung hindi sigurado na may trabaho pa sila ng mga buwan na ?yan? Kaya ang isang panukala natin, dapat una yung taasan yung sahod nila,? she said.
For health professionals, she aims for at least P50,000 per month of the minimum wage. Right now, private sector nurses earn around P645 per day in NCR. For hospitals outside NCR, however, nurses earn less than the mentioned amount each day.
To address this, Andamo brought up the Magna Carta of Public Healthcare Workers, to ensure full enforcement for local government units. If elected, she will amend the Magna Carta so that healthcare workers receive the right benefits.
For private sector nurses, Andamo mentioned the Magna Carta of Private Health Workers, wherein workers would also receive enough benefits.
Ensuring the security of tenure
The National Productivity Wage Board has divided workers into two categories: agricultural and non-agricultural. Nurses in the private sector fall under the non-agricultural category. Moreover, Andamo said some nurses remain contractual workers, despite the nature of their job. Due to the current state of healthcare workers, most Filipinos are forced to apply abroad to pursue better pay and working conditions.
?Dapat po mayroon silang security of tenure. Regular sila or permanent ang kanilang mga position para hindi sila nag-aalala na after three months wala na uli silang trabaho,? Andamo said.
?Kasi pag hindi ka permanent wala kang benefits. Like kung nabuntis ka, nagkasakit ka, wala kang leave, hindi po ba napakahirap naman non. At unfair din kung nagkasakit ka dahil sa pagduduty mo wala ka manlang leave o sick leave ganon,? she added.
If nurses are compensated properly, they may be encouraged to work in the country. Additionally, better working conditions indicate that a safe nurse-to-patient ratio would be carried out.
Jocelyn ?Alyn? Andamo is a nurse and health activist running for a senatorial seat under Makabayan."
Nars Alyn Andamo,"Nurse Jocelyn Andamo, the Senate Aspirant Who Hopes to Cure the Nation's Health Care Ills",2-Oct-24,https://phkule.org/article/1307/nurse-jocelyn-andamo-the-senate-aspirant-who-hopes-to-cure-the-nations-health-care-ills/,"By sacrificing opportunities abroad, Andamo has deeply impacted the communities she has served. Now, she is ready to make yet another sacrifice to serve the Filipino people in the Senate.


Opportunities to work abroad came knocking at Jocelyn Andamo's door, promising a higher salary and an easier life. But she never answered. Though she knows that her scant pay as a local nurse may not compare to the compensation abroad, her heart remains committed to healing those in the communities she serves and remedying the ills that afflict the nation.

When the Makabayan bloc announced its 10 Senatorial candidates on August 26, 61-year-old Andamo took the stage to advocate for Filipinos' rights to free, accessible health care and higher wages for health workers. For Andamo, the long-entrenched issues in the health sector cement the need for immediate meaningful change?and she is determined to deliver that in the Senate. 

Andamo's candidacy represents a unique opportunity for genuine representation of health workers, grounded in her lifelong dedication to the health sector. Yet the path to her bid is fraught with challenges, as she must navigate a corrupt political environment where resources flow into the pockets of wealthy political dynasties while grassroots leaders continue to be undermined and vilified.

 

A Call to Heal
Andamo's first love was dentistry, a passion sparked by her parents?both dentists?who may have implanted the importance of care from a young age. 

But with financial constraints that threatened her education and that of her six siblings, Andamo had to rely on her aunt in the US who offered to cover her tuition fees under the condition that she pursues nursing. Though reluctant at first, she gradually discovered a natural compassion to serve those around her. 

When her training required her to live with an Indigenous farming community for two weeks in the Quirino province, Andamo had a clearer grasp of the country?s health crisis. It was her first experience with community work as a nursing student. She realized that the lessons on poverty she learned during class did not fully capture the harsh realities these families faced. 

The community struggled with poor harvests, preventing them from adequately feeding their families. Malnutrition among the children was rampant. To make matters worse, health facilities were out of reach, making access to immediate care nearly impossible. 

""[Marami] akong areas na [napuntahan] na hindi pa sila nakakita ng nars o doktor. Ganoon ka-deprived yung mga tao of health services, [at] doon ko nakita yung malaking tulong ko sa mga tao,"" said Andamo. 

Since then, her heart has been set on serving as a nurse in the Philippines. Andamo found herself at odds with her family, who could not fathom why she would turn down opportunities abroad that her peers eagerly chase. 

But Andamo remained firm in her decision, expressing that her passion for serving communities was most important to her. ?[She] has many relatives abroad. Despite that and despite the lure of better salary and career advancement, she stayed and pursued her advocacy for people's health,? said Eleanor Nolasco, Filipino Nurses United (FNU)?s president. 

After Andamo graduated with a nursing degree from the Far Eastern University in 1983, she joined multiple nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that united community nurses and encouraged them to stay in the Philippines. Eventually, these NGOs realized the need for an organization focusing on nurses' welfare and labor rights. This led to the establishment of FNU in 2015, where Andamo currently leads as its secretary-general. 

?We are different from other organizations or specialty nursing organizations that deal with the practice of the nursing profession because we are solely dedicated to the labor rights and welfare of nurses,? said Nolasco. Having worked together for over 40 years, Nolasco said that their shared commitment to serving communities and advocating for health workers' rights unites her and Andamo.

 

The Cost of Care
Andamo believes that the fight for health workers' welfare is inextricably linked to the pursuit of accessible health care for all Filipinos, driving both her and the FNU to fight for meaningful change. 

The fragmentation of the health care system in the Philippines, resulting from the government's decision in 1991 to devolve national services to local government units, is just one of several factors contributing to ongoing challenges in health care delivery, said Andamo. As a result, health services in disenfranchised areas became more elusive, found a 2018 World Health Organization (WHO) report.

Absent a comprehensive nationwide framework, health care development in the Philippines remains uneven. Only 25 percent of cities and municipalities meet the WHO's recommendation of having at least 4.45 skilled health professionals per 1,000 people, per a 2022 study. Rural and conflict areas are the most underserved. 

Compounding the problem of understaffing is the neglect and exploitation by the government that continue to drive nurses away from the profession. Frequently enduring 12 to 16-hour shifts, nurses receive inadequate compensation?at least a minimum of around P36,000 in government hospitals and P12,000 in private facilities.

Nurses in the Philippines earn the lowest in Southeast Asia, while nurses in Vietnam and Singapore earn P62,000 and P236,400 on average, respectively. In provincial hospitals, Filipino nurses were reported to earn only 65 percent of the legally mandated pay. This disparity stems from precarious and insecure arrangements. Many nurses in public hospitals work on short-term contracts with lower pay, said FNU.

In response to the persistent mistreatment of nurses nationwide, FNU has fervently worked to mobilize and foster meaningful dialogues with government agencies such as the Department of Health. Through their lobbying efforts, the labor association secured an increase in the entry salary for government nurses in July 2020. And 11 months later, FNU successfully blocked the demotion of long-standing senior nurses, according to FNU?s reports.

FNU remains steadfast in its mobilization efforts, actively participating in various rallies to amplify their calls for a better health care system. The labor association continues to engage with the government, releasing statements and maintaining open dialogues to advocate for the rights of nurses. 

Despite some victories in their movement, Andamo said that genuine representation in the Senate would drive more substantial change for the Filipino people. Nolasco emphasized the need for action both in the streets and the legislature, noting that while organizing nurses is vital, entering the legislature would enable the swifter passage of policies that benefit communities at a larger scale. 

?Ibang klase yung crisis natin na ?yang policies ng government worses the people?s lives, including [their] health,? said Andamo. ?Naisip ko kunin yung opportunity para mas makapaglingkod sa ibang larangan. [It is a] continuation of my service to the Filipino people.?

 

Curing Afflictions
In a political terrain dominated by established wealthy politicians, the road to securing a Senate seat is a daunting task. The lack of sufficient funds and human resources to launch a national campaign are Andamo?s biggest challenges. 

Andamo also feels that her age makes it harder to manage physically demanding activities as the campaign period approaches. But this does not stop her from fighting for their cause. She draws her strength from the support of her family, friends, and other cause-oriented groups. 

Her platform prioritizes improving the health sector in the Philippines, aiming to solve fragmentation through the renationalization of health services and assets. To enhance the welfare of health workers, Andamo proposes a wage of P33,000 for entry-level health workers and P50,000 for all nurses nationwide, in both private and public sectors.

?Yung libreng serbisyong pangkalusugan para sa bayan, yun talaga ang magiging [advocacy] ko sa road sa Senado,? said Andamo.  

House Bill 00208, principally authored by the Makabayan bloc in the 19th Congress, contains plans to implement a free, comprehensive, and nationalist health care system in the country. Unlike the Universal Health Care Act?s structure that results in high out-of-pocket costs for Filipinos, the proposed bill aims to establish a genuinely 100-percent free health care system for all.

The bill has been pending with the Committee on Health since July 2022 and has yet to be sponsored in the Senate. If given the win, Andamo will prioritize lobbying for its immediate passage. 

Despite all doubts, Andamo and Nolasco?s spirits remain optimistic that even without a secured victory, there is no loss in building a platform that amplifies the needs of the Filipino people. ?Manalo o matalo ang aming pagtakbo sa Senate, panalo ang mamamayang Pilipino kasi ma-vo-voice out namin [kung] ano yung aspirations ng maliliit na tao,? said Andamo. 

Andamo?s candidacy is a culmination of her years of self-sacrifice and service, presenting a chance to heal the long-neglected wounds of the nation. By championing the needs of the Filipino people, she seeks to restore trust in a system that has often failed them, fostering a meaningful recovery for the entire country. "

Andamo, RN, former secretary-general of Filipino Nurses United

Amid low wages and spiraling prices of food and basic commodities, hunger and disease are inevitable. This is the time that Filipinos need free and complete health services from government hospitals and other health facilities.

Naghuhumiyaw ang miserableng realidad ng kahirapan at malalang sitwasyong pangkalusugan. Mga kababayan natin ay pumipila sa outpatient department kasing-aga ng alas-2 ng umaga. Umaapaw ang pasyente sa mga pasilyo at bangketa ng mga pampublikong ospital. Mahal ang laboratory at gamot.

Five out of 10 Filipinos die without seeing a nurse or a doctor. Those who live in remote barrios cannot seek health consultation. They do not have enough money for transportation to go to a barangay health station.

Health is a basic right enshrined in the Constitution. Government should provide free, complete and quality health services in public hospitals and facilities, especially during this hunger rise, joblessness and poverty. The public health care system should also be strengthened.

Why is health coverage passed on to Philhealth, or the Philippine Health Insurance Corp.

Philhealth is a government business enterprise designed to earn profit through its health insurance scheme. Its health benefits to members are limited. Patients shoulder out-of-pocket medical expenses of 45 percent. Meanwhile, it mandates payments from employed Filipinos. Why should there be payments for Philhealth when Filipinos already pay taxes? This is double taxation.

Philhealth has been used as a milking cow by its officials. Through the years, Philhealth has been the subject of massive scrutiny after allegations of corruption and scandals. Even during Covid pandemic, Philhealth has been rocked with allegations of fund mismanagement and overpricing.

Philhealth makes profits from health and people?s hard-earned money. It should be abolished. Instead, the government should provide free, complete, and quality health services in public hospitals and facilities. It is constitutionally obligated to protect, promote, and provide health services to the people. This is possible by increasing the budget for health to five percent of the gross domestic product. Funds should be directly allocated to public hospitals and health facilities. The public health care system should be strengthened to truly serve the needs of the people."
Bam Aquino,Bam Aquino backs extension of SUCs in every municipality,27-Apr-25,https://www.inquirer.net/438570/bam-aquino-backs-extension-of-sucs-in-every-municipality/,"MANILA, Philippines ? Senatorial candidate Bam Aquino has expressed support for the proposed extension of  State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) in each municipality to bring higher education closer to the masses.

He said in a media interview in Pagadian City on Saturday.

?Iyan ang isang hangarin ng napakaraming probinsiya, local government leaders at mga kabataan na mapalapit ang mga eskuwelahan doon sa iba?t ibang lugar sa ating probinsiya,? Aquino said, as quoted in a press release.

(That is one of the goals of many provinces, local government leaders, and young people ? to bring schools closer to different areas in our province.)

?Suportado natin iyan. We want to see na talagang maaabot ng edukasyon ang bawat kabataang Pilipino,? he added.

(We support that. We want to see education truly reaching every Filipino youth.

He then assured the locals that the law on free college education for the city?s students would be given sufficient funding if he ever wins the election.

?Pag binalik niyo ako sa Senado, papangalagaan natin ang batas na ito. Pagtutulungan po natin upang tumaas iyong pondo, mas maraming kabataan ang makikinabang, mas maraming pangarap ang maaabot,? Aquino said.


(If you return me to the Senate, we will safeguard this law. We will work together to increase the funding, so that more young people can benefit and more dreams can be achieved.)

?Sisiguraduhin po natin, may suporta ang Pagadian mula sa batas ng libreng kolehiyo,? he added."
Bam Aquino,Role reversal: Ex-VP Robredo now cheerleader to Bam Aquino,15-Jan-25,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2025021/role-reversal-ex-vp-robredo-now-cheerleader-to-bam-aquino,"MANILA, Philippines ? For the 2025 midterm elections, former vice president Leni Robredo and former senator Bam Aquino will change roles, with the former presidential bet being a cheerleader for her campaign manager who seeks a return to the Senate.

Robredo in a Facebook live on Tuesday said that once the campaign season for the national election starts, she will go all-out to campaign for Aquino.

Aquino, cousin of former president Benigno Aquino III, was the campaign manager of Robredo when she ran for president in 2022, and her successful vice presidential run in 2016.

?We can?t campaign yet. But on February 11, it will start. The campaign starts then. We?ll really go all-out, with our former colleagues from the campaign,? she said in Filipino during a livestream, which also featured Aquino who visited Naga City.

Robredo also said that she considers Aquino an older brother even if she is older, as the former senator has guided her during her election campaign.

?He?s younger than me, but I see him as an older brother because during the national elections, he was the one who took care of everything. I know how good of a person he is, I know how capable he is,? she said in Filipino.

?I told him I will do everything I can to help him in the election,? she added in Filipino.

Robredo is not seeking any national spot in the 2025 midterm polls, opting to run for Naga?s mayoral post ? a position once held by her late husband, former Interior secretary Jesse Robredo.

Aquino meanwhile is trying to return to the Senate.  He was a member of the legislative body from 2013 to 2019.

Bam Aquino,Bam Aquino pushes for ?just transition? for jeepneys,28-Feb-25,https://www.inquirer.net/430592/bam-pushes-just-transition-for-jeepneys/,"MANILA, Philippines ? Senatorial candidate Paolo Benigno ?Bam? Aquino said on Thursday he would push for a just transition for jeepneys should he be elected in May.

In a dialogue with the Batangas Transport Cooperative in Mataasnakahoy, Batangas, the former senator who is eyeing a comeback promised jeepney operators and drivers that he would review the government?s Public Transport Modernization Program (PTMP) and make sure they would be able to cope with its regulations.

The PTMP mandates the phaseout of diesel-powered public utility vehicles in favor of Euro-4 models. But transport groups argued that the costs of transitioning were too steep, with Euro-4 vehicles costing around P2.4 million.

?We need to look at whether you can really do it,? Aquino told the transport group. ?We also want to modernize and follow the government?s program, but what we?re pushing for is just transition. Nobody gets left behind.?

If elected, Aquino said he would lobby for increased government support for transitioning jeepney operators and drivers. This includes increased subsidy for new units, which is currently set at P180,000 each."

Bam Aquino,Bam Aquino: Performance over pedigree,24-Apr-25,https://www.manilatimes.net/2025/04/24/opinion/columns/bam-aquino-performance-over-pedigree/2097780,"IMAGINE 10 people. Eight of them just want to have simple lives ? food on the table, money to get their kids a good education, and have fun with family and friends. The other two people want to control everybody else and so they get seven people to hate the one at the bottom ? for random reasons. For example, deciding that anyone who is accused of being a drug addict doesn't deserve rights. Or proclaiming unity when you really only want control and conformity. Everything is so polarized. I don't blame people who want to step away from anything connected to politics.

You're different. You know that the role of the government is to keep you physically safe, socially free and provide an enabling environment for you to achieve financial security. You know that legislators decide how much of your money the government takes, and then how it's spent ? so you shouldn't give a blank check to someone you wouldn't even trust with P5,000. You know senators conduct investigations into how laws are implemented, play a key role in impeachments and shepherd bills into law ? so you don't want to vote for someone you wouldn't even trust to babysit your children.

This election is more about what you don't know.

We know that trolls care less about the country and more about likes and clicks to prove that they manipulated the maximum number of people. This has led to a breakdown of trust in public discourse and a citizenry that is too cynical to even hope for change. We know why thought-terminating clichÈs like ""ganyan talaga"" or ""wala namang magbabago"" are often so effective when paired with mockery like ""ang dami mong alam."" We know the Liberal Party came off as arrogant entitled jerks who belittle others; don't understand the feelings of families affected by rampant crime and drugs; and even slurp soup funny. But, none of those things are relevant. They just made you more concerned with the imperfect practice of an ideology instead of objectively looking at what a candidate has accomplished and what he plans to do.

You might know that you're ""not a Filipino for nothing,"" but do you know what you are a Filipino for? Are you fighting for participatory governance on a national level? Or are you fighting for the privilege to inflict what was done to you on other people? Do you know that the frustration and anger toward ""Imperial Manila"" is valid but the weaponization of that pain is not?

There is so much you don't know and don't want to know.

The most glaring issue is that you don't know what it is you have against Bam. Is it the 41 laws that he authored across multiple sectors? Or the shenanigans he stopped as part of the blue ribbon committee? Was it his incredible work as the youngest senator in the 16th Congress or as the youngest head of a national agency (National Youth Commission at age 25)? Was it that time that he challenged a former separatist to live up to their ideals and build a better country instead of playing politics? Does it go back to his ability to maximize scant resources as a social entrepreneur and enable Hapinoy to provide financing and mentoring to over 15,000 microentrepreneurs when he was CEO? Is it that he has dedicated his entire adult life to empowering the youth and the poor? Does his summa cum laude from Ateneo threaten you because you support a candidate whose diplomas are fake? None of these things could possibly bother you. These are all signs of relentless service, careful thought and the ability to foster political action instead of political gestures.

Unless what you hate is his last name and his relatives? Or perhaps his face and his resemblance to someone you'd like to forget? Because Bam had no control over those last few things, and it's illogical to punish him for it.

Bam can only catalyze change in the public sector if you put aside any distaste for his relations to judge him objectively ? using the metrics you'd want to be assessed on. You might hate his family or former party, but shouldn't you love our country more? We need public servants with integrity, intelligence and a vision for a better future for all. Bam has proven that he is great at the job, and I'd be happy to rehire him. You ought to be honest about why you don't.

ACT Teachers Party-list Rep. France Castro cannot help but be emotional after she was convicted for child abuse by a Tagum, Davao del Norte court.
She cited the irony in the case as she has been teaching children and fighting for their rights in the last 25 years.
Castro, during an interview with reporters at the Batasang Pambansa complex on Monday, admitted feeling bad about the decision.
The case stemmed from complaints that she and former Bayan Muna Party-list lawmaker Satur Ocampo kidnapped Lumad students from Talaingod town.
The guilty verdict was handed down earlier for violation of Republic Act No. 7610 or the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act.
?Off all cases pa, ano ko? as teacher, 25 years nating pinangalagaan ang ating mga estudyante. Ngayon, child abuse pa ang ika-kaso sa akin. So, talagang nakakalungkot, kasi ako pa na teacher na talagang nangalaga sa kapakanan ng mga estudyante,? Castro said.

(Off all cases pa, I will face child abuse cases when I as a teacher, for 25 years, we have taken care of our students. So it is really saddening, because I, as a teacher, have been really taking care and looking out for students? welfare.)

?Medyo emotional ako kasi, as teacher, ang naging trabaho ko naman talaga ay pangalagaan ?yung kapakanan ng mga estudyante, at siyempre, ?yung pagbigay ng knowledge at ganitong kaso pa ang ikakaso sa akin, child abuse. Kaya parang masama ang loob sa ganitong desisyon ng judge,? she added.
(I have been emotional because as a as teacher, I was working to ensure the safety and the welfare of students, and of course, imparting knowledge, and then I would face this case ? child abuse. That?s why I feel bad with this decision of the judge.)
However, Castro said she and Ocampo will not evade justice, saying that they intend to question the decision.
?But anyway, like we said, we will face this case squarely and we will not hide [?] At any rate, like what Ka Satur said, we would appeal and face this decision, and well, deny this decision handed against us,? she said.
?Our resolve is strong and we feel that this will be dismissed at the end of the road.  And we will face this, we would not hide, evade our laws and our justice system. We are ready to face the people and say we really did nothing wrong. No child abuse. We did not do these allegations because our advocacy is for the education of the youth and Lumad children,? she added.
Castro and Ocampo, along with 16 others, were arrested by police in November 2018 for allegedly holding 14 minors, reportedly to teach them revolutionary ideas against the government.
The group was on board five vans which were intercepted at a police and military checkpoint in Talaingod.
The minors, who Castro and Ocampo said were being rescued, are students of a Salugpungan School in Sitio Dulyan, Palma Gil in Talaingod."

Trade union activist France Castro is the former secretary-general of the Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) of the Philippines and is currently a parliamentarian in the House of Representatives. In April this year, Castro received the 2019 Arthur Svensson International Prize for Trade Union Rights, and October she won the Febe Velasquez Trade Union Rights Award ? both for her work in defence of trade union and human rights. She met with Equal Times in October, a week before two ACT members were shot by masked gunmen in their classroom, to discuss the violence and harassment facing trade unionists in the Philippines, as well as her fight to defend the rights of the Lumads, an Indigenous population in the south of the country.


The ITUC Global Rights Index lists the Philippines as one of the ten worst countries in the world for workers. What is the reality on the ground?
Being a trade unionist now in the Philippines is dangerous, because the Duterte administration doesn?t like those of us who are fighting for human rights, for trade union rights and who oppose the different anti-people policies of his government. That is why our union is now experiencing political persecution.
Last year, for example, we were profiled. The members of the National Security Council led by the police had a memorandum, though they did not admit it, and they would go from one school to another, asking for members of the ACT. This is a violation of our rights and of the privacy of our members, and of course, it also affects our freedom of association. Our members are afraid and in some regions they are leaving our union.
Our members and leaders have also received threats, sometimes death threats. Recently, the president of our union in Region 5 (Bicol) received an envelope containing his profile and the profile of his family members. It is a form of intimidation.
Many members of your union are victims of ?red-tagging? [editor?s note: a practice aimed at tarnishing a person?s reputation and discouraging them from organising, asserting their rights and criticising government policies]. What are the consequences?
In the Philippines when you are red-tagged, or when there is a terrorist tagging of your union or your organisation, it means you are linked to supporting terrorist groups?which is absolutely not true. So if you are red-tagged, that means that the police, the military, the paramilitary and other interest groups target you.
That is what is happening, not only in my union, not only in the progressive block, but in the opposition, the media, journalists, and other sectors like women?s groups and the poor, etc.
How does your union fight against propaganda and abuse?
We denounce the profiling of our members publicly, through press conferences and press releases. We also file cases against the police. We continuously educate our members about fake news, unfounded terrorist tagging and red-tagging against us. We are continuing to educate our union members and we report incidents. And in the Congress, through my office in the House of Representatives, and with my colleagues in the Nationalist block we continue to file resolutions, to investigate these human rights violations.
Our union is very grateful for the international support given by international organisations. It helps protect our leaders and members, and it says to the Duterte administration that our members, our unions, are protected internationally. The awards we have received, like the Arthur Svensson Prize and the Febe Velasquez Trade Union Rights Award, also give us some protection. This is proof that what we are doing as unionists is right. I hope it will inspire woman trade unionists to try hard, to help their union, and to stay in the union.
And our union members should not be afraid. They should continue to fight for their rights. We know that we have the backing of international solidarity and that this protects us as long as we continue our union work.
You also opposed the government to support the education rights of Indigenous people. Why this commitment?
We support the most disadvantaged and the most marginalised. This includes the Lumads, an Indigenous people living in the southern Philippines. Since time immemorial, they have been fighting for their ancestral domain, for self-determination, but they have scarce access to social services because they are very far from the city. Their land is under threat from mining companies and agri- business, it is being militarised, and the government is doing everything it can to drive the Lumads to live in the city. The government has abandoned their right to education, that?s why the community themselves built the schools, that we call the ?Luman schools?, with the help of NGOs and civil society organisations.
We helped them with the school curriculum, the school supplies and with teacher training. The Duterte government resents us for this support because in its eyes, the Lumads who resist government control of their territories are ?rebels? or ?terrorists?; if we help them, we are accused of helping ?terrorists?.
In November 2018, at the invitation of the Lumads, I participated in a national mission in their region because their schools had been closed. There were roadblocks in the area set up by the authorities. The Lumads thought that as I am a parliamentarian, the military and police would let me through, but on the contrary, shots were fired and stones were thrown at my vehicle. My companions and I were arbitrarily detained on false charges for 18 hours by the police.
Has your union taken a position on extrajudicial executions by the authorities?
Yes, since the Duterte administration started its bloody war on drugs in 2016, it has resulted in thousands of people being killed on the streets. We take a strong stance against the policy of the Duterte administration. He is very mad at that. He doesn?t want people to oppose anything he is doing. He is always afraid of the words ?human rights?.

France Castro is one of the brave people who stands up for democracy and workers? rights. She worked as a teacher and established a union in Quezon City. A few years later, she was elected Secretary General of the Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT), and took the lead assembling teachers in one trade union.
Under the leadership of France Castro, ACT has rapidly grown to become one of the largest trade unions in the Philippines. In 2016, the union negotiated the first collective agreement for public school teachers, an agreement that recognizes the right to strike.
France Castro took the struggle for important workers? issues to Parliament when she was elected Member of Parliament in 2016. She pushed for the expansion of maternity leave for all women to 105 days, a bill that recently passed the Parliament, and she has fought for higher minimum wages. As a teachers? representative she has fought against neoliberal reforms in education and filed bills for the rights and welfare of education workers.
Besides these issues, she has fought against lowering the minimum age of criminal responsibility, the mandatory Reserve Officer Training Corps in senior high school as well as the targeting of minors in the regime?s ´anti-drug warª, which has resulted in extrajudicial killings and illegal detention and arrests of thousands of young people. Together with her union, she has for years defended indigenous people?s right to education, an engagement that led to her being attacked by paramilitary forces and detained during a solidarity mission in Lumad schools in Talaingod last November. Both inside and outside the Parliament.

The Philippines is among the 10 worst countries in the world for workers and trade unionists.

In a context of extreme state violence and suppression of civil liberties, workers and trade unionists face threats and intimidation from both the regime and companies, and have to fight for their rights."

Pia Cayetano raises hopes for children with birth defects, 6th ICBD",11/11/2013,https://www.pchrd.dost.gov.ph/news_and_updates/sen-pia-cayetano-raises-hopes-for-children-with-birth-defects-6th-icbd/,"Notwithstanding a super typhoon, Senator Pilar Juliana ?Pia? Cayetano shared her cause for children with birth defects and disabilities to Filipinos and foreign delegates at the recently held International Conference on Birth Defects and Disabilities (ICBD) last November 11, 2013 at Mactan, Cebu.
Sen. Pia?s own experience as a mother led her to advocate the rights of children with rare diseases. She gave birth to a child with trisomy-13, a type of chromosomal disorder. He had a cleft lip, tumors in his liver, and enlarged kidneys, causing him to live for nine months only. Though it was heartbreaking, Sen. Pia became emotionally prepared after undergoing genetic counselling before giving birth.
?How many women are unable to have emotional preparedness because we deprived them of this preparedness?? She emphasized.
Motivated by her own experience, Sen. Pia currently works on passing a law concerning birth defects and disabilities, together with health professionals, particularly Dr. Carmencita Padilla, the Director of Newborn Screening Reference Center ? National Institutes of Health. She also encouraged Filipinos and even foreigners to share their cause with lawmakers for better progress in this important health issue.
Sen. Pia has a foundation named ?Gabriel Symphony? that supports children with manifestations of Trisomy-13. The foundation conducts cleft operations and projects for visually impaired children and those with hearing loss.
As a senator, she served as Chairperson of the Committee on Health and Demography and Committee on Youth, Women and Family Relations in 2010. She also worked for the passage of landmark laws: Reproductive Health Act (RA 10354), to provide women and families with access to information and services on reproductive health, and the National Health Insurance Act of 2013 (RA 10606), inclusion of the lowest income segments of the population in the PhilHealth system.  Her other legislative accomplishments included Mandatory Infants and Children Health Immunization Act (RA 10152), Establishment of Persons with Disability Affairs Office Act (RA 10070), and Universally Accessible Cheaper and Quality Medicines Act (RA 9502).

Pia Cayetano,Cayetano wants probe on visa-related issues of PH athletes,2/7/2025,https://www.pna.gov.ph/index.php/articles/1243593,"MANILA ? Senator Pia Cayetano has filed a resolution seeking to investigate the delay in the issuance of visas to Philippine athletes and their coaches, which affected their performance in international competitions.
In filing Senate Resolution Number 1312 on Wednesday, Cayetano also raised the need to review the current procedures of the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC), the Philippine Olympic Committee (POC), the National Sports Associations (NSAs) and the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) in helping the athletes secure visas and other necessary travel documents to identify issues and implement necessary solutions to prevent delays and ensure that ?the athletes can focus on their local and international training and competitions without unnecessary hindrances.?
?National athletes, together with their coaches, when competing internationally, represent the country akin to diplomats, as such, they should be provided with adequate government support that would allow them to focus, free from Visa-related stress and uncertainties,? the resolution reads.
The resolution cited the experience of Filipino pole vaulter and Olympian, Ernest John Obiena, in September 2020 when he encountered visa issues that prevented him from competing in the Doha Leg of the Diamond League.
It said this happened a day after Obiena set ?a new personal season best of 5.80 meters and securing the bronze medal in the Rome Leg of the same League.?
Another athlete, Dota 2 player Erin Jasper Ferrer, failed to participate in the 2024 PGL Wallachia tournament because of visa issues.
In her resolution, Cayetano said ?Article II, Section 17 of the 1987 Constitution declares that""[t]he State shall give priority to education, science and technology, arts, culture, and sports to foster patriotism and nationalism, accelerate social progress, and promote total human liberation and development;
?While there are existing laws, such as Republic Act (RA) No. 9064, as amended by RA No. 10699, otherwise known as the ""National Athletes and Coaches Benefits and Incentives Act, there remains an urgent need to strengthen and enhance these laws and other relevant policies in order to provide them with sufficient assistance, particularly in relation to travel and Visa concerns,? it added.

As chair of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee, Cayetano emphasized the need for ?proactive and sustained? collaboration between the Philippine Statistics Authority, Bureau of Immigration, Department of Foreign Affairs, and local government units, particularly their civil registries, to prevent similar schemes in the future.

Last year, the Senate launched an investigation into the unauthorized issuance and use of government documents by foreign nationals, including certificates of live birth, passports, and tax identification numbers.

?The hearings exposed systematic fraud in our civil registration system, particularly through the issuance of birth certificates via late registration,? Cayetano said.

The senator highlighted that foreign nationals, including those linked to illegal Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs), exploited vulnerabilities in the registration system. She warned that this issue goes beyond fraudulent documentation and poses risks to national security."

Cayetano made the comment after the Visayas failed to send a team to the 4th Pinay in Action (PIA) All Women?s Football Cup which ended on Sunday at Tionko Football Field here.
She said the Visayas has not signed up for the PIA football meet ?because there are no players?.
Cayetano, a triathlete and former national volleyball player, said she would push an approach supporting grassroots sports programs at the local level.
?Football is not strong at the collegiate level. So we have to start local initiatives,? said Cayetano, former senator, during a ceremonial kick off on Saturday.
Cayetano said the provinces and cities will have to decide which sports they think their kids could excel.
She added that she would focus more on sectors that have difficulty in securing financial assistance like the persons with disabilities and the children with special needs.
She added that she also supports the creation of a separate department of sports.
A total of 15 teams from Mindanao and Luzon including University of the Philippines (UP) and University of Sto. Tomas participated in the three-day football event aims to empower women and girls by providing a healthy lifestyle.

In a radio interview on Tuesday, D?Angelo said that due to the 1987 Constitution stating impeachments should be processed ?forthwith?, the matter of Vice President Sara Duterte?s impeachment should have been tackled within 24 hours after it was received by the Senate.

He added the impeachment court was the only way for Duterte to prove her innocence, as she is immune from being sued in any other courts while she is in office.

?Nakalagay doon ?forthwith?. Ibig sabihin immediately without delay. There?s even a definition. It should be within 24 hours, so dapat tumatawag na ng impeachment proceedings si Senate President Chiz Escudero bago pa 'yan magamit as a defense of Sara Duterte na dinelay ninyo ito, kaya 'yong inyong impeachment process ay hindi niyo na dapat ituloy,? he said.

Angelo de Alban,Alumnus declared a ?nuisance?; Angelo de Alban goes to SC,28-Jan-19,https://varsitarian.net/special-reports/20190128/alumnus-declared-a-nuisance-angelo-de-alban-goes-to-sc,"LAWYER Angelo de Alban, a University faculty member, has appealed to the Supreme Court to allow him to run for the Senate in the 2019 midterm polls, after he was declared a ?nuisance? candidate by the Commission on Elections (Comelec).

Comelec identified de Alban as among the 13 bets lacking the financial capacity to mount a nationwide campaign. Only 63 candidates made the cut.

In a petition filed in October of last year, Comelec questioned de Alban?s intention to run for senator and his capacity ?to sustain the financial rigors of waging a nationwide campaign.?

De Alban, a former Varsitarian writer, said he had filed a motion before the high court, saying the Comelec?s first division committed a ?grave abuse of discretion? by rejecting his bid for the Senate.

?It is unfortunate that the Comelec preempted the highest court by releasing a second list and conditioning the public. We are praying that the [Supreme Court] will issue a TRO (temporary restraining order) to include my name again,? said de Alban in a text message.

He said Comelec did not give a definite timeline in finalizing its ruling, which has delayed the process.

?We are prepared to elevate the matter to the highest court in order to settle once and for all this unreasonable and discriminating label of nuisance candidate,? de Alban added.

In December of 2018, Comelec?s law department originally declared 95 candidates as ?nuisance? for lacking the financial capability to run a nationwide campaign.

Section 69 of the Omnibus Election Code defines ?nuisance? candidates as those who make a mockery out of the election process, cause confusion among voters by using similar names with other candidates, and have no bona fide intention to run for the office.

Should he be allowed to run and win a seat, de Alban said he would focus on education, health, agriculture and housing.

Political analyst Ramon Casiple said joining a political party could have helped de Alban avoid the said disqualification.

?A candidate may be disqualified on the basis of being a nuisance candidate [that is if he does] not have a campaign machinery, financial capacity or physical ability to mount a campaign in the jurisdiction in which he plans to run. Usually, this is cured by being in a political party,? Casiple told the Varsitarian in an email interview.

UST economics alumnus and former solicitor general Florin Hilbay made it to the list under the Aksyon Demokratiko Party.

The UP law graduate, who helped win the government?s case over the West Philippine Sea in The Hague, said he would focus on improving the quality of education in the country and defending the Constitution from attempts to be amended.

The midterm elections, to be held on May 13, will fill seats in the Senate, the House of Representatives and local governments.

The official campaign period for senatorial candidates and partylist groups will begin on Feb. 12 while the period for local bets will start on March 29."
Angelo de Alban,Senatorial bet Angelo de Alban wants to raise legal marriage age to 24,19-Mar-25,https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/939733/senatorial-bet-angelo-de-alban-wants-to-raise-legal-marriage-age-to-24/story/,"Independent senatorial candidate Attorney Angelo de Alban pushed for amendments in the Family Code of the Philippines, including raising the legal marriage age to 24.

Among his proposed changes were to raise the requirements for marriage, including a higher age requirement, financial literacy, age-appropriate sex education, and psychological tests.

?Napakadali ng kasal ngayon para ka lang nabili ng SIM card, 18 years old, may consent, tapos na. Siguro, gawin nating 24 or 25. May scientific na basis po ito. Yung ating pre-frontal lobe, dito sa bunbunan po natin, yan po yung gumagabay satin para sa mature decisions? Dapat itaas mo ng konti yung requirements mo sa kasal,? said the lawyer-professor.

(Getting married is so easy that it?s just like buying a SIM card, you just have to be 18 years old with consent and it?s done. I think we should make it 24 or 25. It has a scientific basis. Our pre-frontal lobe or the top of our head is what guides us to make mature decisions? We need to raise the requirements for marriage a little bit.)

?Napakadali magpakasal, tapos pag naghiwalay sila after two years sasabihin ay dapat may diborsyo sa Pilipinas. In the first place, bakit papayagan na magpakasal nang maaga?? he added."
Angelo de Alban,"#BakitIkaw: Angelo de Alban vows to push for better benefits for children with special needs, more courts in Senate",19-Mar-25,https://dzrh.com.ph/post/bakitikaw-angelo-de-alban,"Independent senatorial candidate Atty. Angelo de Alban is pushing for the provision of benefits for children with special needs and persons with disabilities (PWDs), along with the establishment of additional courts nationwide, if elected.

""Ako ay sa children with special needs and persons with disabilities, iyan ang ating adbokasiya. At laban natin sa korapsyon sa pamamagitan ng husgado iyan ang kailangan nating tutukan,"" de Alban said during the Bakit Ikaw: The DZRH Job Interview on Tuesday.

He noted that the improvements he envisions for the country can be accomplished only if he is in the Senate, highlighting the need for laws that provide free therapy and developmental assessments for children with special needs, as well as livelihood programs for their families.

De Alban explained that therapy and developmental assessments are not only challenging but also costly, which is why the government must assist, particularly those in the most disadvantaged communities.

""Pangalawa, kailangan natin ng batas para mai-angat ang pondo ng husgado sapagkat ang husgado lamang ang constitutional, legal, and feasible solution sa laban natin sa korapsyon,"" he added.

He stated that with additional courts, more judges would expedite case proceedings, preventing witnesses from dying and ensuring swift justice. This would allow the immediate imprisonment of the corrupt and the acquittal of the innocent.

Moreover, the lawyer pointed out that many innocent people are rotting in jail because the pace of justice is too slow. However, he clarified that this is not the fault of the judges, as they are overloaded and understaffed.

Source of funding for benefits for children with special needs

With his advocacy, he mentioned that funding for these initiatives can be sourced by creating laws that draw from both national and local sources, emphasizing that children with special needs and persons with disabilities are also taxpayers.

""Bakit sila kailangang magmakaawa sa mga pulitiko tuwing eleksyon para lang magkaroon ng free therapy and free developmental assessment?"" said de Alban.

""Ang taong nagbabayad ng buwis, hindi dapat nagmamakaawa na mapaglingkuran. Karapatan ng bawat tao na mapaglingkuran sila,"" he added.

Amendment of the Family Code of the Philippines

The senatorial candidate further disclosed his stance on amending the Family Code, pointing out the necessity to adapt to the societal changes taking place.

He noted that while some provisions can still be retained, the Family Code, established in 1987, needs to be updated due to the many years that have passed.

""Ang gusto kong pagbabago diyan ay ang requirement sa pagkasal. Kasi napakadaling magpakasal ngayon, parang kala mo bumibili ng sim card. 18 years old may consent tapos na,"" said de Alban.

""Dapat itaas natin ?yan. Siguro gawin nating 24 or 25. Bakit ho? May scientific na basis po ito,"" he added.

He explained that if someone is immature, like an 18-year-old who has just watched a romantic movie on a cold day, they might easily say, ""let's get married.""

While marriage may seem simple, they might later argue that divorce should be legalized in the Philippines.

Furthermore, he suggested that in addition to raising the age requirement for marriage, individuals should also undergo financial literacy, sexuality education, and psychological testing to better equip themselves with the necessary knowledge.

On the other hand, despite admitting that he does not agree with same-sex marriage, he stated that members of the LGBTQ community should be given protection. This includes granting them the opportunity to represent their partners in transactions.

""Itong mga bagay na ito, dapat ilagay natin sa Family Code. Huwag nating ilagay ito sa SOGIE bill, huwag natin itong ilagay sa separate bill,"" de Alban explained.

""Kasi I consider members of the LGBTQ community as co-equal. Kapareho natin silang tao, dapat equal ang treatment natin sa kanila,"" he added.

He then reiterated that the LGBTQ community is a powerful force in the country and should be treated equally, as they are one of the driving forces behind the nation's progress.

In terms of abusive relationships, he advocates for extending protection to all genders, emphasizing that anyone can be subjected to violence. He stressed the importance of focusing on cases like these.

""May mga relasyon talagang mapanakit kaya dapat ?yan ay ating tinututukan. Gawin nating all gender ang proteksyon at hindi lang sa kababaihan at kabataan, pati ang mga kalalakihan na rumerespeto sa dangal ng kasal,"" he explained.

Steps to achieve peace in the country

De Alban emphasized that the Philippines is not divided into two opposing families. He noted that, like the global stage, where the world is not just split between the U.S. and China, there are numerous countries the Philippines can align with, reflecting the same diversity in its political landscape.

""Pumili tayo ng tumatakbo na para sa kapakanan, sa interest ng ating kinabibilangang komunidad,"" he noted.

He once again emphasized the need to increase funding to establish more courts and hire additional judges to combat corruption, stating that if peace is desired, it cannot exist without justice.

""Ang hustisya natin ay maibibigay lamang ng husgado sapagkat ang husgado ang only constitutional, legal, and feasible way to defeat corruption and to ensure na mabigyan ng hustisya ang lahat ng tao,"" de Alban added.

De Alban has served for 17 years as a litigation lawyer and 16 years as a law professor at the University of Santo Tomas.

With his legal background and knowledge, the candidate is confident that he can motivate future leaders, asserting that he has no ties to corruption and has the solutions to combat it."
Angelo de Alban,Senatorial bet eyes nationalizing 'Right to Care' card,20-Feb-25,https://tribune.net.ph/2025/02/20/senatorial-bet-eyes-nationalizing-right-to-care-card,"Lawyer and educator Angelo de Alban has pledged to expand the Right to Care card ? a document allowing same-sex couples in Quezon City to make medical decisions for their partners ? on a national scale if elected to the Senate.

Speaking at the ""Harapan sa Diliman: A Senatorial Forum"" on the Equality Agenda, de Alban also called for government funding for the mental health needs of the LGBTQ community and persons with disabilities (PWDs).

""We need to provide free therapy to those in need and developmental assessments for LGBT children because we won?t know if they have challenges unless they undergo assessment,"" de Alban said in Filipino.

He also emphasized the need to institutionalize the Right to Care card, which is currently limited to Quezon City residents.

""The government must prioritize LGBTQ individuals and PWDs. We should expand and institutionalize what Quezon City has done with the Right to Care card, which authorizes same-sex partners to make medical decisions for each other,"" he added.

The Right to Care card, introduced in 2024, is based on a Special Power of Attorney and was created in the absence of national legislation granting LGBTQ couples the same rights as heterosexual couples in medical settings.

De Alban previously ran as an independent candidate in the 2019 Senate elections, but the Commission on Elections declared him a nuisance candidate, citing concerns over his ability to sustain a nationwide campaign.

Coming from a family of lawyers and educators, de Alban earned his Bachelor?s Degree in Journalism, Law degree, and Master of Laws from the University of Santo Tomas. In 2008, he co-founded a school for children with special needs alongside his family members."

In an event at the Commission on Human Rights, De Guzman signed the ?Youth Agenda,'' where he agreed to support an increase in the education budget to cover rising costs, reject proposals for a mandatory ROTC, require schools to use renewable energy sources, and pass the universal students? Magna Carta.

De Guzman also wants Congress to pass a comprehensive sexuality education law.

?Hindi natutugunan ng kasalukyang sistema ng edukasyon ang pangangailanga na turuan, gabayan at higit sa lahat i-empower ang kabataan sa usapin ng kanilang sekswalidad, na siyang pinagsasamantalahan ng mga predator,? said de Guzman.

Labor leader Leody de Guzman is advocating for stronger labor rights and fair wages as part of his Senate campaign, emphasizing the need for workers to have greater political power.

Drawing from his 12 years of experience as a factory worker in Pasig, he emphasized the need for political power among laborers to ensure their rights are upheld.

""Nakita ko yung panggigipit, panglalamang ng mga kumpanya laban sa mga manggagawa, kaya naisip ko noon na kailangan talagang ipaglaban ang karapatan nila,"" he said during ABS-CBN's Harapan 2025 on Friday.

While unions play a crucial role in protecting workers, de Guzman believes they are not enough.

""Pero tingin ko, hindi sapat yung pag-union kasi kailangan magkaroon ng political power yung mga manggagawa para sila na yung magdesisyon sa batas na magbibigay proteksyon sa mga karapatan nila,"" he added.

He criticized the current wage system, saying it suppresses workers' ability to afford basic needs and participate in economic growth.

""Mali yung framework ng mga negosyante na binabarat nila yung mga manggagawa. Kapag binabarat niyo sila, wala silang pambili ng mga produkto ng mga kapitalista,"" he said.

De Guzman supports a ?200 wage hike and the removal of provincial wage disparities.

""Tama yun at kulang pa nga. Dahil ang sinasabi ng gobyerno, 1,207 ang dapat tinatanggap ng mga manggagawa dahil sa mataas na presyo ng mga bilihin ngayon,"" he said.

He also proposed price regulation and removing restrictions on wage increases to help address inflation.

FRESH LEADERSHIP
Meanwhile, in his bid for a Senate seat in the 2025 elections, De Guzman cited the need for fresh leadership in the chamber.

""Malaking tulak talaga, dahil nakita ko yung mga tumatakbo?sila-sila pa rin. Minsan apat na beses, tatlong beses babalik sa Senado na wala namang nagawa,"" he said.?
De Guzman urged voters to support and vote for leaders from marginalized sectors rather than political dynasties.

""Tingin ko, napatunayan natin na ang mayayaman, mga sikat, mga dynasty, mga trapo. Ilang beses na natin sila pinagbigyan, walang nangyari,"" he said

""Subukan naman na karapat dapat diyan mga lider ng sektor. Ito yung pagkatiwalaan,"" he added."

""Ang tunay na opposition yan ang nagsusulong ng interes ng manggagawa at interes ng masang Pilipinong mahihirap sa ilalim ng kapitalistang paghahari at ng kasabwat nilang trapo at dynasty. 'Yun ang totoong opposition,"" he said.

""'Yan ay dala-dala ng iba't ibang grupo na lumalaban ngayon na galing sa sektor ng paggawa at galing sa sektor ng magsasaka, sektor ng masang Pilipino, ang mga lider ng sektor na tumatakbo ngayon ang siyang tunay na opposition na kumakatawan sa interes ng 90% ng mamamayang Pilipino.""

The labor leader said candidates like him and labor lawyer Luke Espiritu, as well as other like-minded bets who do not have the same machinery as ""bigger name"" and ""familiar"" hopefuls represent the opposition.

""Ang kalaban namin ang kampo ng kadiliman at kampo ng kasamaan na kinakatawan ni Duterte at Marcos na nagrerepresent sa interes ng mga mayayaman, ng mga korporasyon, ng mga bilyonaryo sa bansa,"" De Guzman said.

""Kapag opposition, hindi yung opposition ng trapo. Pag opposition ng trapo siyempre Duterte?  At ang Duterte at Marcos, iisa ang pinaglilingkuran, mga kapitalista, interes ng mga malaking korporasyon,"" he added.

When asked if there are efforts to unite with other candidates with similar advocacies, De Guzman said there are ongoing talks and renewed calls for unity.

""Tuloy-tuloy naman yung effort? Pero tuloy-tuloy ang aming panawagan. Pero kung hindi man maganap ang isang malaking pagkakaisa, nagkakaisa kaming lahat laban sa dynastiya, laban sa kontraktualisasyon, laban sa trapong pulitika at laban sa pagsasamantala ng iilan sa ating sambayanan,"" he said.

De Guzman and Espiritu are both running under Partido Lakas ng Masa.

Bato Dela Rosa,Dela Rosa admits attempt to disguise himself failed,25-Mar-25,https://globalnation.inquirer.net/269893/dela-rosa-admits-attempt-to-disguise-himself-failed,"MANILA, Philippines ? He tried to hide by wearing a cap, a mask and a jacket, but his attempt to disguise himself failed.

This happened while he was in Bicol, according to Sen. Ronald ?Bato? Dela Rosa.

?Hindi kaya (It didn?t work),? he said when asked in a phone interview on Tuesday if he would disguise to evade the possible arrest on the order of the International Criminal Court (ICC).

Dela Rosa and former President Rodrigo Duterte are facing charges of crimes against humanity before the ICC in connection with the Duterte administration?s war on drugs.

?Tinry ko na nagcap-cap ako, nagjacket ako, nag mas- mask ako, nakita ako ng isang tao dun sa Bicol. Sabi sakin nung  tao na nagbebenta  dun sa Bicol ng kamote: Kilala kita!  Si Bato ka! Si Bato ka,? Dela Rosa said.

(I tried wearing a cap, a jacket, and a mask, but someone saw me in Bicol. The person selling sweet potatoes in Bicol said to me: ?I know you! You?re Bato! You?re Bato!?)

?Sabi ko, wala na patay na kaya napilitan tuloy ako na bumili ng tinitinda nyang kamote dahil mag-iingay man na andun ako. Nakita ako eh. Kilala kita si Bato ka,?  he added.

(I was forced to buy the sweet potato she was selling because they would make noise if they saw me there. They saw me: ?I know you, you?re Bato.?)

Amid the threat of a possible arrest, Dela Rosa continues to go around the country to campaign for his reelection bid in the May 2025 elections.

Though he initially wanted to seek protection from the Senate, Dela Rosa later admitted that he was also considering hiding to evade the ICC arrest."
Bato Dela Rosa,Solon raises concern over Dela Rosa's impartiality in drug war probe,16-Oct-24,https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1235713,"MANILA ? Manila Rep. Bienvenido Abante Jr. warned on Wednesday that Senator Ronald ?Bato? Dela Rosa?s close ties with former president Rodrigo Duterte could undermine the impartiality of the Senate investigation into the previous administration?s war on drugs.

Abante, who co-chairs the House of Representatives' Quad committee, cited Dela Rosa?s rapid rise from brigadier general to Philippine National Police (PNP) chief during Duterte?s presidency as a key concern.

?I would think that he (Dela Rosa) would be more biased than actually balanced in that hearing,? he said in a press conference.

Dela Rosa earlier announced that the Senate would conduct its own inquiry into the drug war, with plans to invite Duterte as a resource person.

Despite concerns regarding Dela Rosa's impartiality, Abante still expressed support for the Senate probe, saying it complements the ongoing House Quad committee investigation.

He added that it would be up to Duterte whether to attend the hearings in the Senate or the House.

?It?s up to him actually? Hopefully, he will come and say what he would like to say,? he said.

The House Quad committee ? comprising the committees on dangerous drugs, public order and safety, human rights, and public accounts ? has conducted eight public hearings, with Duterte?s name repeatedly surfacing in connection with extrajudicial killings tied to the drug war.

In a recent hearing, retired PNP colonel and former Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office general manager Royina Garma testified about a reward system for killing drug suspects.

Leonardo?s testimony

Abante said he believes that it is only a matter of time before former National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM) Commissioner Edilberto Leonardo testifies in the House probe.

?Until such time that Col. Leonardo would submit to us an affidavit, doon namin siya isasalang (Until such time that Col. Leonardo submits an affidavit, only then will we put him [in the hearing]),"" he said.

Abante said Leonardo is expected to testify once his sworn statement is submitted, possibly during the committee?s next hearing on Oct. 22.

Garma?s testimony implicated Leonardo, who previously served as chief of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) in the Davao Region, in implementing the reward system during the Duterte administration.

Leonardo is believed to have further knowledge of the operations and policies that fueled the controversial war on drugs, according to Abante. (PNA)"
Bato Dela Rosa,Bato Dela Rosa claims he was promised ICC ?won?t touch a hair? on him,13-Mar-25,https://globalnation.inquirer.net/267351/dela-rosa-claims-he-was-promised-icc-wont-touch-a-hair-on-him,"MANILA, Philippines ? Sen.  Ronald ?Bato? Dela Rosa on Thursday claimed he was promised that not even a strand of his hair would by be touched by the International Criminal Court (ICC).

According to Dela Rosa, this promise was made to him and former President Rodrigo Duterte by none other than President Ferdinand ?Bongbong? Marcos during a conversation in MalacaÒang.

Duterte and his then-top cop, Dela Rosa, are facing allegations of crimes against humanity before the ICC  in connection with the administration?s drug war campaign that left thousands of people killed.

The former president has already been arrested by local authorities at the request of the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) and is now under the ICC custody in the Hague, Netherlands."
Bato Dela Rosa,Why investigate yourself?': Lawmakers tell Bato dela Rosa,17-Oct-24,https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2024/10/17/2393240/why-investigate-yourself-lawmakers-tell-bato-dela-rosa,"MANILA, Philippines ? House lawmakers on Thursday, October 17, raised concerns over Sen. Ronald ""Bato"" dela Rosa?s call for a Senate inquiry into extrajudicial killings during the Duterte administration?s war on drugs, citing a ?clear conflict of interest.? 

They argued that the investigation may lack impartiality, given Dela Rosa's and Sen. Bong Go's alleged involvement in carrying out the drug war and the reward system for police officers.

Rep. Dan Fernandez (Santa Rosa, Lone District), one of the House quadcom?s co-chairpersons, said in a statement that Dela Rosa ?would be practically investigating himself,? which is ?highly inappropriate.?  

Drug war architect. This is because Dela Rosa had served as the Philippine National Police chief general who implemented the war on drugs campaign under former President Rodrigo Duterte, he said. 


?This undermines the integrity and objectivity of any findings that may result from this investigation,? Fernandez said.

Rep. Bienvenido Abante (Manila, 6th District), chair of the House Committee on Human Rights, said in a press conference on Wednesday that Dela Rosa would be ""more biased."" 

He argued the Senate inquiry should be independent and exclude public officials directly involved in the drug war.

Rep. Arlene Brosas (Gabriela Women?s Party) shared a similar sentiment, emphasizing the accusations made against Dela Rosa by several resource persons at the House mega panel?s hearings on drug-related EJKs. 

?Sino ang iimbestigahan niya, sarili niya? (Who will he investigate, himself?)? she said in a statement on Thursday.

Facing accusations. The allegations suggest that Dela Rosa was knowledgeable of the EJKs committed under his leadership and was the one who forced self-confessed drug lord Kerwin Espinosa to implicate former Sen. Leila de Lima in the illegal drug trade.  

Resource persons have testified that the drug war included a cash reward system for police officers for each drug suspect killed. House lawmakers are investigating the sources of these funds, specifically whether they were drawn from confidential funds or the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office.

The drug war under Dela Rosa's leadership resulted in extrajudicial deaths of at least 6,000, according to government numbers. However, human rights groups have tallied this figure to reach 30,000. 

Brosas added that Dela Rosa?s probe into the EJKs is a ?diversionary tactic? and may only whitewash the involvement of those responsible for the extrajudicial killings.

?This planned investigation by Sen. Bato, who himself was accused of playing a central role in Duterte's war on drugs, is nothing but a biased attempt to sanitize their involvement,? she said. 

?Investigations in the House and Senate should be in aid of legislation, not in aid of self-preservation,? Rep. Raoul Manuel (Kabataan Partylist) said in a Filipino statement on Wednesday.

Rep. Robert Ace Barbers (Surigao del Norte, 2nd District) had a different perspective on Dela Rosa?s plan to conduct a Senate investigation into the EJKs, despite Dela Rosa being a central figure in orchestrating the drug war. 

No problem with parallel inquiry. In an interview with ANC on Thursday, Barbers acknowledged the Senate's authority to conduct a parallel inquiry, noting that there are no legal prohibitions against it.

Barbers, the overall chairman of the House quad committee, clarified that he does not believe Dela Rosa is attempting to ""exonerate"" himself, emphasizing that the panel is not accusing anyone in its ongoing investigation.

?The quadcom is not accusing anyone, we?re just hearing issues and hearing testimonies coming from all witnesses who wish to share their information on the subject matter that we are deliberating on,? he said.  

However, he also asked, ?Why would you investigate yourself in your own committee?? 

On Wednesday, Dela Rosa denied claims that the inquiry would contradict the House mega panel?s probe into the drug war?s EJKs, saying that he would ?stick to the facts, stick to the records.?  

A day after Dela Rosa announced his plans, Sen. Risa Hontiveros on Thursday urged all senators to take part in the Senate?s investigation into the Duterte administration?s war on drugs. 

She proposed that the probe be conducted by the committee of the whole, allowing the participation of all senators rather than limiting it to specific Senate committees.

The House joint committee has invited Dela Rosa, Go and Duterte to participate in the upcoming public hearings as resource persons, allowing them to present their perspectives and defend against the allegations made against them."
Bato Dela Rosa,Ronald dela Rosa: 'The Rock' behind Duterte's drugs war,"27 June 2018

",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44598858,"It might have fallen away from international headlines, but state-sanctioned drug war killings continue in the Philippines. As the former chief of police tells the BBC's Howard Johnson in Manila, it's provided a cover for anyone wanting to kill with impunity.

Since the Philippine government launched its all-out campaign on drugs in July 2016, it says more than 4,000 suspected drug users and dealers have died in police operations.

Urged on by President Rodrigo Duterte, the police swept through predominantly poor communities targeting suspects on ""drug lists"" compiled by local community leaders.

Nightly images of bloodied bodies splayed across roads and alleyways were broadcast around the world.

Rights groups now put the number of dead at more than 12,000. They say many of the killings, including those by vigilantes, were extra-judicial and therefore illegal.

The police argue that all of the killings were made in self-defence after the suspects resisted arrest.

'We did not shy away'
The man behind the campaign, the then Chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP) General Ronald dela Rosa, told the BBC the campaign had not been ""perfect"", but that he was ""proud"" of his record.

""I can say we attacked the problem head-on,"" he said when we met in Manila. ""We did not shy away from the problem. The drug problem is very, very big in the Philippines.""

Gen dela Rosa insists the president never gave him ""shoot to kill"" orders
Nicknamed The Rock, Gen dela Rosa was widely considered the chief enforcer of Mr Duterte's punitive anti-drug campaign.

The two men had worked closely together before, when Mr Duterte was mayor of Davao city.

As the city's police chief between 2012 and 2013 Mr dela Rosa implemented his ""Oplan Tokhang"" - ""knock and plead"" - anti-drug campaign that saw police officers scour neighbourhoods to apprehend suspected drug dealers and users.

In July 2016, shortly after Rodrigo Duterte became president, Gen dela Rosa was appointed director general of the PNP. He went on to apply the same strategy - deploying undercover stings known as ""buy-bust"" operations - on a national scale.

So was he given a shoot-to-kill mandate?

""No, I would like to make it clear to the whole world,"" said Gen dela Rosa.

""President Duterte did not give me an order to to kill. Anyone. He just told our policemen that if your life is in danger you have to protect yourself so it's better that the criminals are killed rather than you.""

Reuters A family friend weeps after Nora Acielo, 47, was gunned down by unidentified men while escorting her two children to school in Manila, Philippines December 8, 2016Reuters
Thousands have been killed in drugs related killings
At the start of the drug war President Duterte was widely criticised by the international community for a number of statements that appeared to encourage the police to kill with impunity.

In September 2016 he said: ""If [drug suspects] pull out a gun, kill them. If they don't, kill them still, son of a whore, so it's over, lest you lose the gun. I'll take care of you.""

This was just hyperbole, said Gen dela Rosa, designed to put fear into the minds of criminals.

Duterte: The 'strongman' of the Philippines

Pushed on whether it is responsible for a head of state to make such statements Gen dela Rosa said there had always been ""some unexplained killings"" in the Philippines, so ""why attribute that to the language of the president?""

But he did admit that the war on drugs provided the perfect cover for hit men, who could kill without fear of being investigated.

Paid killers could kill someone in public, then place a cardboard sign on the body alleging involvement in drugs to cover up the true motive behind their killing. That way, the community ""will not be so hot on the solution of the case"" he said.

Carlos Conde of the campaign group Human Rights Watch said that while it ""may be true that criminals are taking advantage of the 'drug war', that's a lame explanation for the thousands of deaths encouraged and enabled by the government from the top down"".

""There are credible accounts by witnesses and families of victims, by human rights groups and even media, of police actions that indicate the killings are government policy.

""But even if we just zero in on the more than 4,200 who died during police operations because they allegedly fought back - that claim begs for an investigation.""

From the streets to the prison
Nevertheless, Ronald dela Rosa is popular in the Philippines. He regularly appears on Filipino TV shows and enjoys posing for photos with the public. He even featured in a controversial iPhone game that shows him and Mr Duterte shooting criminals. The game was later removed from the Apple app store.

He became a household name in the Philippines after he cried during a senate hearing into the death of a provincial mayor while in police custody over alleged illegal drug possession.

Fighting back tears, he told senators he couldn't blame the public for losing trust and confidence in the police because he himself no longer knew ""whom to trust"".

The death of teenager Kian delos Santos was a step too far for many in the Philippines
Under his watch the war on drugs was temporarily suspended twice because of miscarriages of justice.

In October 2016 a South Korean businessman was kidnapped and murdered by officers at the national police headquarters in Manila under the pretence of a drug-war arrest.

Then in September 2017 a 17-year-old student was killed during an anti-drug operation. Amid huge protests, police officers later admitted they had no evidence Kian delos Santos was involved with drugs.

The PNP resumed control of the drug war in November 2017, but a few months later Gen dela Rosa was moved from PNP police chief to become the director general of the Bureau of Corrections.

As the head of prisons, he has made it his goal to wipe out the drug trade inside the country's main detention centre, New Bilibid Prison, home to many of the country's top drug lords.


According to Gen dela Rosa, past inspections revealed inmates were ""living like kings"" - some cells were furnished with ""jacuzzis"" and ""recording studios"".

""They can't do it any more,"" said Gen dela Rosa ""On the very first day in office I told them: 'Right here, right now, I'm the boss. You're not the boss'.""

Then, referencing the Netflix series Narcos, in which Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar controlled a prison nicknamed The Cathedral, Mr dela Rosa added: ""Bilibid is not your cathedral any more.""

'We're not hiding anything'
In February this year the International Criminal Court (ICC) said it had begun a preliminary examination of claims filed by a Filipino lawyer that the government had committed crimes against humanity during its handling of the drug war.

Mr Duterte responded by saying he wants to remove the Philippines from the jurisdiction of the ICC, accusing it of violating due process.

But Gen dela Rosa said he would welcome ICC investigators.

""We're not hiding anything. We are open,"" he insisted.

""What is difficult is if they are just hearing reports coming from the anti-Duterte critics who are bringing those reports to them. Then they will be blinded by false reports or 'fake news'.""

Such is Gen dela Rosa's popularity many are tipping him to run for senator in 2019. Recent opinion polls suggest he would stand a good chance of being elected if he were to stand.

But he says he is waiting for the approval of President Duterte before he makes a decision to enter politics. If he gets the green light, he said he would campaign to introduce the death penalty for drug offenders and to bring in a nationwide ID card system.

Asked if he had aspirations of becoming president himself one day he said: ""I'll leave that to God. Destiny, destiny. My becoming the chief of the PNP is destiny already."""

""The ICC is not all about justice. ICC is about control. They are not after justice, they are about controlling all the member nations of the ICC. Bakit? Kita ko ito sa kaso natin sa Pilipinas (Why? You can see it in the case in the Philippines),"" Dela Rosa said.

The senator was not able to elaborate his answer further due to lack of time, but he was referring to the ICC's ongoing investigation into the Duterte administration's war on drugs, where he earlier tagged himself as the ""number two accused.""

Dela Rosa, who served as the Philippine National Police (PNP) chief when the controversial drug war was launched, recently said that he will seek relief from the Supreme Court should the ICC pursue its investigation in the Philippines."

Just before 2020 ended, urban poor activist Eufemia ?Mimi? Doringo received disappointing news. Pandi town in Bulacan, a province north of Manila, declared her persona non grata because its local government officers said they will not allow her ?fighting ideologies to prevail.?

The order prohibiting her from entering the town stemmed from a protest action, which local authorities barred. This left Doringo, secretary general of urban poor group Kadamay, no choice but to assert their rights to gather and seek redress from the government due to its slow and wanting social protection amid the pandemic.

?It was very infuriating. I wanted to go to Pandi immediately as soon as I heard it,? Doringo told Bulatlat in a phone interview.

The Bulacan town became controversial when homeless Filipino families occupied abandoned government houses originally intended for state forces and their families. This after a series of dialogues with concerned government agencies proved to be futile."

Aplikante, Mimi Doringo said the government should stop treating the matter like a business and start treating it as a basic public service.

?Wala magaganap na demolisyon sa anumang komunidad ng mga maralita kung walang maayos na relokasyon,? said Doringo. ?Kapag sinabi nating maayos na relokasyon, dapat disente, abot-kaya, pang-masa, at pampubliko ?yung mga pabahay na ipatatayo, na may kabuhayan ?yung mga tao.?

She pointed out that without these basic conditions, many relocated families are forced to return to danger zones or informal settlements to survive.


She also criticized how the current public housing programs burden poor families with heavy loans, penalties, and interest rates. She added that many relocation sites lack even the most basic services like water, electricity, and decent construction.

?Twenty-four square meters na unit, pero aabot ng isang milyon (ang bayad?). Wala ngang pera ?yung mga maralita, bakit natin sila sisingilin? Dapat ang pabahay sa atin ay pang-publiko at abot-kaya,? said Doringo. ?Ang pabahay, karapatan ito ng bawat mamamayan kaya dapat hindi siya ginagawang negosyo ng ating pamahalaan.?

In 2023, Pres. Bongbong Marcos Jr. said his administration is targeting building six million public housing units for 30 million Filipinos.

Doringo blamed the National Housing Authority (NHA) and other government agencies for failing to deliver accessible public housing, urging the abolition of compounding interests and ballooning fees that trap families in debt.

?Kailangan talaga ?yung pondo ng taumbayan mula sa buwis na pinaghihirapan nating lahat ay magamit bilang pondo para sa mga serbisyong panlipunan at hindi para sa bulsa ng iilan,? stressed Doringo.

In 2018, the NHA and its contractors were flagged for using substandard materials in public housing projects for earthquake victims in Leyte."

Wala namang ma≠giging sagabal sa naging aksyon na pagbalasa ni Gamboa dahil dumaan naman ito sa Napolcom, kaya sigu≠radong legal ito sa imahe ng kapulisan, hehehe!

Labor leader and Partido Lakas ng Masa (PLM) senatorial candidate Luke Espiritu said justice for the actions of former President Rodrigo Duterte must reach its completion and not be ?half-baked.?

Duterte was arrested by authorities on Tuesday after the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued a warrant against him for crimes against humanity allegedly committed during his administration?s bloody war on drugs.

?Ang parusa ay dapat kompleto, hindi half-baked? Justice, hindi political expedience, justice dapat ang mananaig sa pagpapakulong at pagpo-prosecute kay Duterte,? Espiritu said in an interview on Tuesday.

(The punishment should be complete, not half-baked? Justice, not political expedience, should prevail in jailing and prosecuting Duterte.)

Espiritu recalled the system that Duterte allegedly implemented to reward police officers for killing drug suspects.

?What we have created is an entire infrastructure for murder and killing. That is what we are left with. That is what you (addressing Duterte) have developed. You have developed a murderous society that even murder is being applauded in our country,? Espiritu said.

?We have become a nation of psychopaths and criminal-minded people. Ganoon ang ginawa ni Duterte. He really destroyed our values and our nation na dapat siya maparusahan. Dapat siya ay maaresto,? he added.

(We have become a nation of psychopaths and criminal-minded people. That?s what Duterte did. He really destroyed our values and our nation so much that he needs to be punished. His arrest is just.)

The Human Rights Watch estimates that around 12,000 people were killed during Duterte?s drug war."
Luke Espiritu,"Luke Espiritu to focus on voters who seek change in senate bid
",16-Feb-25,https://www.abs-cbn.com/news/nation/2025/2/16/luke-espiritu-to-focus-on-voters-who-seek-change-in-senate-bid-2051,"MANILA ?  Senatorial candidate and labor lawyer Luke Espiritu said they will focus on tapping voters who seek change in government and want alternatives to ""traditional politicians"" and political dynasties in his 2025 bid.

Espiritu is running for the Senate again alongside fellow labor leader Leody de Guzman under the Partido Lakas ng Masa.

The lawyer shared what he learned from his previous bid for the upper chamber when asked about his ranking in recent pre-election surveys.

READ: Labor leaders Leody de Guzman, Luke Espiritu announce senatorial bid
""Ang na-realize ko na hindi ang challenge ang rule ng mga dynastiya. It's not the challenge. It is not true at all na ang ating pulitika ay naghahati lang sa kasamaan at kadiliman. Maraming puwersa sa atin ang sinusuka ang kadilimaan at kasamaan, sinusuka both si Marcos at si Duterte at yun ang aming market,"" he said.

In identifying their market, Espiritu said he will focus on gaining their trust to hopefully convince them to vote for him and de Guzman.

""We build forces, the forces for change. We address the forces of change. Ang mga kabataan for example, ang mga Gen Z na ayaw na sa luma, gusto na ng bago. Mga manggagawa na patuloy na lumalaban,"" he said.

""We address those forces, we strengthen those forces. And we do know that it's just a matter of time dahil bankrupt na sila and exposed na yung dynasties na yan. It's just a matter of time that these forces will also influence the entire Philippine society na oppressed hanggang ngayon,"" Espiritu added.

The labor lawyer said the candidates of the administration, reelectionists and other popular bets are still dominant because they have the funds and machinery.

""Alam natin na dominante pa rin sila ngayon. Pero ang suporta na na-gegenerate sa pera na minumudmod nila ay mababa, hindi galing sa prinsipyo,"" Espiritu explained.

""Kapag kumparahin niyo nalang ang binibitbit natin sa kanila, sila empty, bankrupt, walang sinasabi,"" he said.

Espiritu said they will work on building their voter base, which he said will be anchored on beliefs and principles.

""Ang suporta na nakukuha ni Luke Espiritu at Leody de Guzman, pag sinuportahan yan, kasama diyan ang paniniwala at pag-aadhere na prinsipyo, mas malakas na klaseng suporta yan,"" he said.

""Kapag palawakin namin yan, we just talk to that market, sa tingin niyo sino magiging malakas? Tanggalin natin ang advantage ng pera, tanggalin natin ang advantage ng makinarya, all things being equal,"" Espiritu added.

The labor lawyer reiterated they will focus on issues instead of dances, jingles and other gimmicks.

Espiritu also ran for senator in the 2022 elections but failed to secure a seat."

The lawyer had gone viral on social media for taking a stand against controversial lawyer Larry Gadon who interrupted him during the SMNI senatorial debates.

Luke Espiritu: Fight revisionism even if its purveyors have billions
Asked on his stance on various issues, Espiritu said he would ""vote for divorce and that ""abortion should be decriminalized.""

""Women's Day was yesterday. Poor women in our country have died by abortions done in an unhealthy environment or through unhealthy methods. They have exercised their choice over their own bodies, which is also tied to the future...If they had children that will be born into poverty, that's even more tragic,"" he told ANC's Headstart.

""We have controlled women?s bodies for too long...telling women when to reproduce, what to think, what to wear. Telling women their limitations. Women should decide. I don?t consider abortion murder. I consider it as a choice of women over their own bodies. I am a man, what right do I have to tell a woman what to do with her body?""

The senatorial candidate said he would also support same-sex marriage.

""I will support thee SOGIE (Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity or Expression) Bill, in fact I would go beyond that I will support the same-sex marriage,"" he said.

""I am not trapo. At the risk of losing votes, I will not compromise on principles...Others will say I'm just for civil union but it's a half-hearted statement. It is pandering both to those who are pro and con. I will definitely stand by my convictions no matter what.""

Espiritu, who graduated from the Ateneo de Manila School of Law, said he came from a middle class family.

""My father was also a lawyer and he had to raise us 7 children so it doesn?t leave too much for savings and to have a privileged lifestyle. People from the middle class they have 2 choices, it?s either to side [with] workers or to side with the capital,"" he said.

""I don?t think my story is unique, There are several others who went in the same path. We don?t have to delve into the past to see Ateneans who sided with the workers or the oppressed. Part din yan ng lipunan na people like us who have education will use that in order to strengthen the movement from below rather than use their talents and skills to enrich the wealthy.""

Espiritu said his role model senator was Benigno ""Ninoy"" Aquino.

""Personally I idolize Ninoy Aquino. Perhaps not Ninoy Aquino of the pre-martial law days but the Ninoy Aquino after that. He has really, in his own fashion, analyzed what keeps us poor, what keeps us shackled to the interest of the wealthy. And he described himself as a Christian socialist,"" he said.

""I?m a proletarian socialist. We have differences in trying to analyze the problems of our society and the solutions but the ending point would still be the same. We want a humane society where society does not take care of the interest of the top 1 percent but takes care of the interest of the majority.""

Asked if he ever thought of joining the Liberal Party, Espiritu said: ""I am a labor leader and I am with the labor movement. There are many differences also in terms of economic policies. I do not believe in the neo-liberal type of development they are trying to push for our country.""

Espiritu said the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos was worse than the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte.

""The regime killed more people under Duterte but I would say it?s still Marcos. With all the authoritarian rule, the powers concentrated in his hands. He made laws by himself without Congress,"" he said.

The possible victory of the dictator's son Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos would be a ""continuity of Duterte,"" he added."

Makabayan senatorial candidate and Piston national president Mody Floranda called for a progressive transport industry as he met with transport cooperatives in Guimba, Nueva Ecija as part of his election campaign.

Floranda said the local transport cooperatives raised concerns over the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program, citing financial burdens.

?P10,000 araw-araw ang binabayaran nila sa nag-iisang may-ari ng prangkisa ng ruta sa sistemang pensyon. Samantala, nakapatong pa dito ang P55,000 kada buwan na kailangan nilang bayaran kada modern unit,? Floranda said in a statement on Wednesday.

(They pay P10,000 daily to a single franchise owner under the pension system, on top of the P55,000 monthly fee for each modern unit.)

?Patunay ito na huwad at negosyo ang modernization program. Sapilitang inihulog sa kumunoy ng utang at dagdag-bayarin ang mga operator,? the senatorial candidate said.

(This proves that the modernization program is deceptive and profit-driven. Operators are being forced into debt and additional expenses.)"
Mody Piston Floranda,Mody Floranda: transport sector champion and PISTON leader emerges with Makabayan to challenge administration Senate lineup,29-Sep-24,https://pistonph.com/mody-floranda-transport-sector-champion-and-piston-leader-emerges-with-makabayan-to-challenge-administration-senate-lineup/,"Mody Floranda, a prominent leader in the transport sector, has emerged as a key Senatorial candidate for the upcoming 2025 midterm elections under the Makabayan Coalition. As the National President of PISTON, Floranda is dedicated to advocating for a pro-people public transport system through national industrialization.

Floranda was formally proclaimed as part of the Makabayan 2025 lineup during the coalition?s National Convention today. The Makabayan Coalition, as the leading opposition, aims to represent marginalized sectors and provide an alternative slate free from political dynasties and corporate influences common within the Alyansang Bagong Pilipinas lineup.

?Ang laging tanong sa amin, paano raw kami mananalo, saan daw kami kukuha ng pondo. Bakit ?di nila ?yan tinatanong sa mga kandidato ni Marcos Jr? ?Pag mayaman at galing sa political dynasty, ok lang bang magnakaw para makaupo ulit sa pwesto? ?Pag mahirap ang naghahangad ng pagbabago, kahina-hinala na?? said Floranda.

Key highlights of Floranda?s platform include: improving the public mass transportation system by increasing the supply of public transport through the local rehabilitation of traditional jeepneys and scrapping of the current corporate-driven and foreign-oriented Public Transport Modernization Program and supporting local manufacturing towards national industrialization.

Despite lacking formal education, Floranda?s extensive experience in serving the transport sector equips him to effectively represent the needs of the people.

Born to a farmer and fisherfolk, he is a former Martial Law torture victim who began his career as a PUV driver in Cubao. He later rose to prominence as a leader within PISTON.

?Sa mga nagdaang taon hanggang ngayon, ang mga batas na ginagawa ng pamahalaan ay nagsisilbi lang sa pansariling interes ng mga nasa kapangyarihan. Kailangan ng taumbayan ng mga mambabatas na tuna na nakakaunawa sa kanilang pang-araw-araw na pagsubok at yung kayang magtulak ng mga makabuluhang pagbabago,? Floranda stated.

He joins a diverse slate of candidates committed to advocating for marginalized sectors. His candidacy reflects a growing movement within Philippine politics aimed at amplifying ordinary citizens? voices and addressing systemic issues through the advancement of national democracy. "

Floranda, current president of†Pagkakaisa ng mga Samahan ng Tsuper at Opereytor Nationwide or PISTON, talked with drivers and operators of jeepneys in Angeles, Pampanga.

He said he is not against modernization, but added that government should not ignore the drivers' concerns such as the high cost of the modern unit.

""Tungkulin ng gobyerno na protektahan ang kabuhayan natin at pataasin ang antas ng pamumuhay ng lahat (The government should protect our livelihood and help improve the quality of life of the people),"" he said.

Senatorial aspirant and PISTON Chairman Mody Floranda is open to talking to newly appointed Department of Transportation Secretary Vince Dizon to iron out issues in the transportation sector.

PISTON stands for Pagkakaisa ng mga Samahan ng Tsuper at Operator Nationwide.

During his interview on ABS-CBN?s Harapan 2025, Floranda said, ?Walang pormal na pakikipag-usap sa atin pero tayo naman ay hindi sarado na makipagtalasatasan. Ang sa atin ay dapat merong malinaw na direksyon ang pag-uusap. Dahil malaki na po yung karanasan natin, marami nang naging Secretary ang DOTr na kung saan nagpalit-palit na pero sa esensya ay talo pa rin ang ating mga driver at operator.?

Floranda is particularly concerned about the PUV Modernization Program (PUVMP) where operators and drivers of public utility vehicles are required to consolidate. He anchors his campaign on the welfare of drivers and operators.

?Yung mga bagong pumasok sa usapin ng programa ay sa ngayon ay nagdadaingan,? Floranda said. ?Sapagkat talagang yung amortization pa lamang ng halaga ng saksayan hindi nila halos mabayaran.?

?Kaya ang sinasabi natin sa ilalim ba ng PUVMP sino ang makikinabang? Ang makikinabang ba ay yung malalaking mga dayuhan na kung saan ay sila ang nagdadala dito sa atin ng mga sobra-sobrang produkto mula sa kanilang mga bansa na kung saa ay pinapatay yung ating sariling lokal na manggagawa?? he added.

Floranda clarified that he is not against modernization.

?Halos nasa eight years na tayong nagre-rehabilitation ng ating mga pampublikong transportasyon sapagkat nakita natin yung pangangailangan ng ating mamamayan kaya sinasabi po namin kung talagang ang layunin ng gobyerno ay para ayusin ang ruta ng public transport, dapat hindi yung pagtatanggal eh, dapat mag-create tayo ng sarili nating industriya para tayo mismo ang lumikha ng ating transportasyon dito sa ating bansa.?

IMPEACHMENT, EDSA ANNIVERSARY

Floranda also stated his opinion about several critical issues in the country.

If he wins and becomes a senator-judge, Floranda is leaning towards convicting Vice President Sara Duterte in the impeachment trial.

?Dapat makasuhan siya at talagang sabi nga natin dapat mapanagot si VP Sara. Kung sa hanay po ng sektor ng transport, yung 125 million ay malaking tulong na sa usapin ng rehabilitation, malaking tulong sa edukasyon, malaking tulong sa usapin ng pangkalusugan,? Floranda said.

The P125 million is part of the confidential funds given to the office of Duterte.

Floranda said the Senate must immediately proceed with the impeachment trial.

?Dapat kagyat itong harapin ng Senado dahil ito naman ay sabi nga natin pinagbotohan ito ng 245 na mga congressman, may malinaw  na tuntungan, basehan yung impeachment na hindi kayang ipaliwanag mismo ni VP,? he said.

?Tingin po natin batay sa evidence na nilatag sa Kongreso ay malinaw ang mga ebidensya. Yung report mismo ng COA, report ng iba?t ibang ahensiya ng gobyerno ay malinaw kasi mismong sa ahensya ng gobyerno nanggaling po yung mga datos,? he further explained.

Floranda also said former president Rodrigo Duterte must face the International Criminal Court (ICC) which is investigating his war on drugs.

As for the spirit of the EDSA People Power Revolution, Floranda believes it is still alive even though another Marcos is in power. February 25, 2025 is the 39th anniversary of the said revolution.

?Tingin natin buhay pa ang diwa ng EDSA sapagkat hindi pa naman natatapos talaga yung fundamental na suliranin ng ating mga mamayan,? Floranda remarked.

He, meanwhile, is against the pivot to the United States when it comes to the territorial dispute in the West Philippine Sea.

?Dapat nananaitling ang Philippine Sea ay pag-aari ng mamamayang Pilipino hindi pinag-aawayan ng malalaking bansa,? Floranda said.

He also wants the Ayuda para sa Kapos ang Kita Program (AKAP) directly given to beneficiaries. ??Ang AKAP po dapat dinidiretso sa serbisyo hindi dinadaan kung kani kanino. Kasi pag idinaan po yan sa iba ibang ahensiya ng gobyerno doon nagca-cause ng malaking korupsiyon.?"
Mody Piston Floranda,PISTON to join three-day transport strike,12-Aug-24,https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2024/08/12/2377357/piston-join-three-day-transport-strike,"MANILA, Philippines ? Transport group PISTON on Monday announced that it will join the three-day nationwide transport strike to protest the implementation of the Public Utility Vehicle (PUV) modernization program. 

In a press conference, the group?s president, Mody Floranda, said that PISTON will join Manibela and other transport groups in holding the ?welga sa ruta.?

?May iba?t-ibang uri ng protesta: Martsa-rally, caravan, welga sa mga routa. ?Yan po ang ating tugon doon sa inannounce ni Bongbong Marcos na hindi na niyab bibigyan ng extension ang ating mga operator,? Floranda said. 

(There are different types of protests: Marches, caravans, and strikes on routes. These are our responses to Bongbong Marcos' announcement that he will no longer grant extension to our operators.)

The transport strike will be staged on August 14 until August 16.

The transport groups were prompted to hold a transport strike after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. expressed his support in the advancing of the PUV Modernization program despite the Senate?s call to halt its implementation.

Marcos claimed that the majority of the jeepney drivers have been consolidated.

On July 31, 22 senators signed Senate Resolution 1096, urging the government to temporarily halt the implementation of the PUV Modernization Program until all concerns of jeepney drivers and operators are fully addressed.

The resolution noted that around 36,217 jeepneys had been consolidated.

The senators said that the lack of consolidation among other units is largely due to the government's insufficient efforts to inform the transport groups about the program, as well as the financial strain caused by the high cost of modern jeepneys."
Mody Piston Floranda,Piston urges Supreme Court to resolve petition to suspend PUV modernization,23-Sep-24,https://www.abs-cbn.com/news/2024/9/23/piston-urges-supreme-court-to-resolve-petition-to-suspend-puv-modernization-1528,"MANILA ? Transport group Piston has urged the Supreme Court to fast-track the resolution of its petition for a temporary restraining order against the Public Transport Modernization Program (PTMP). 

In the motion to resolve filed by Piston Chairperson Mody Floranda and legal counsel Atty. Kristina Conti on Monday, the group asked the court to resolve the petition to prevent further injury on the part of the jeepney operators and drivers and their families, as well as commuters and the public. 

?There is serious pressure and threat from government to comply with what petitioners assert to be unconstitutional orders,? Piston said in the petition.

SC urged to halt PUV modernization program as apprehension looms

The group noted that protest and resistance to the forced consolidation of franchises continue, with drivers and operators mounting nationwide transport strikes.

?Ang kailangan natin ay payagan nila ang mga driver at operator na makapag-renew ng mga prangkisa, ibalik sa 5 taon,? Floranda said.

Piston added that many of its members have sold their jeepneys for scrap and surplus parts.

?Marami na po tayong mga driver na nagchop-chop na ng kanilang mga unit, para po sa kanila sa totoo lang kung bakit kami naghahabol sa Korte Suprema kasi baka naman may pagkakataon pa na makabalik sila,? Conti said.

Budget chief: Jeepney modernization not on DOTr?s 2025 priority list

President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in August rejected the call of 22 senators to suspend the program due to supposedly insufficient information drive on the PTMP and the financial burden on drivers and operators to procure modern jeepneys. 

""I disagree with them because sinasabi nila minadali. This has been postponed seven times, the modernization has been postponed for seven times,"" Marcos previously said. 

He added that around 80 percent of operators have complied with the PTMP?s requirement to consolidate into cooperatives for easier processing of bank loans to buy modern jeeps.

DOTr says with 83% consolidation rate, no need to suspend PUV modernization program

The government launched the PUV modernization program in 2017. There have been multiple delays in its implementation due to protests and COVID-19.

Drivers opposed to the plan argue that buying a new vehicle will bury them in debt and they will not be able to earn enough money to repay their loans and make a living.

Financing will make or break PUV modernization, says senator

While jeepneys now vie with buses, vans and motorbikes for passengers, they are still a common sight and sound in the country.

Often brightly painted and with an exhaust that sounds like a trumpet, jeepneys cost passengers as little as P13 to ride and their second-hand diesel truck engines are easy to fix.

The modern mini-buses the government would like to replace them with are more high-tech, with European emission standard engines or electric motors, WiFi, CCTV and air-conditioning."

Speaking to reporters in an ambush interview, Gamboa said he intends to push for a law that would create an office that would monitor fake news 24/7 should he be elected senator.

(That?s a big problem. Currently, there?s no one monitoring it so that?s one of the very first things that we will do. We will create a 24/7 office where people may report fake news.)

Gamboa said his primary motivation to run for senator is his countrymen?s frustration over politicians.

(Our countrymen are frustrated because there are politicians, although they help sometimes, whom people feel are only lying and not listening to the people. That?s what we want to change.)

In ABS-CBN?s Harapan 2025, Gamboa said, ?Instead of parating nagrereklamo tayo na hindi nila ginagawa, ako na mismo, para ako na mismo yung tatakbo, ako na mismo yung susubok na ma-elect para ako na yung magbabago ng mga change na gusto ko.?

Gamboa is an entrepreneur who discovered his passion for content creation and founded Models of Manila TV on social media.

He was also a vlogger for former Manila Mayor Isko Moreno during the 2022 elections.

?Na-enjoy ko yung pagkakampanya,? Gamboa said. ?Parang ang saya mangampanya to meet people, makipag-usap, alamin mo kung ano ba yung sitwasyon. Doon pa lang there?s a feeling inside me na gusto kong tumakbo.?

He said he was also inspired by Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto.

?Nakita ko yung change na kayang gawin kapag yung mga leader ay mahusay, kapag yung mga leader ay marunong makinig sa tao at maayos yung kanilang nagiging trabaho,? Gamboa said.

One of the things he would like to pursue is establishing a fake news monitoring office, especially since many have weaponized social media and use it to spread lies. 

?Kapag paulit-ulit yung isang page na nagkakalat ng fake news, doon na papasok yung pag-iimbestiga ng opisina na ?to at kung kinakailangan, ipapasa na sa cybercrime,? Gamboa explained. ?So merong pupuntahan yung tao to verify kung fake news ba o hindi. Wala kasi ngayon, kasi walang masumbungan eh.?

Gamboa has had his fair share of bashing, but he said this does not deter him from making commentaries.

?Hindi tayo puwedeng porke?t sasabihan ka ng masakit, pipigil ka na magsalita. Hindi eh. Lalo na kapag ang pinaglalaban mo tama, kapag ang pinaglalaban mo ay alam mong makakabuti para sa nakakarami,? he remarked. 

?Hindi ko naman pinipilit yung mga tao na paniwalaan lahat ng sinasabi ko. Sa akin nga, pakinggan mo yung sa kabilang side, pakinggan mo dun sa isa pang side, then you make your own decision.? 

Gamboa said he is not paid by anyone to make political commentaries. 

Although he supports certain candidates, he believes Filipinos should not fight just because of politics."

Bong Go,Bong Go pushes for government interventions to support small farmers amid inflation and other economic challenges,"Septemper 09, 2023",https://senatorbonggo.ph/press-release/Bong-Go-pushes-for-government-interventions-to-support-small-farmers-amid-inflation-and-other-economic-challenges,"Senator Christopher ?Bong? Go calls on government to provide more support to small farmers as they are the backbone of the nation's economy and play a crucial role in maintaining the country's food security. 

Go, member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, has been supportive of legislative efforts aimed at uplifting the lives of Filipino farmers, particularly in these challenging economic times. He contributed to the passage of Republic Act No. 11953, known as the New Agrarian Emancipation Act, which he co-sponsored and co-authored in the Senate.

This landmark legislation condones loans, including interests, penalties, and surcharges, incurred by agrarian reform beneficiaries. By doing so, it aims to alleviate the financial burdens faced by over 600,000 agrarian reform beneficiaries across the Philippines, thereby enhancing their economic resilience.

In addition to this, Go also authored and co-sponsored RA 11960, or the One Town, One Product (OTOP) Philippines Act. This law decentralizes economic opportunities by empowering each town and province to develop and promote their unique products.

By doing so, it not only fosters community-led innovation but also bridges the urban-rural economic divide, providing small farmers with more avenues to market their produce.

Go also emphasized the importance of encouraging end users to directly purchase from producers. This not only helps the farmers but also ensures that consumers get fresh and affordable produce.

""It's not only about us not needing to import from other countries. It's about recognizing and supporting our local farmers and agrarian reform beneficiaries,? Go added.

As the nation navigates through economic challenges, Go reiterated that the most important thing is that no one goes hungry.

""Dapat po, walang magutom. Importante po dito tiyan ng bawat Pilipino,"" he said.

According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, inflation rate rose to 5.3 percent in August, up from 4.7 percent in July. The increase in inflation was primarily due to the faster rise in prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages.

Specifically, inflation for food and non-alcoholic beverages accelerated to 8.1 percent in August. The year-on-year growth rate for rice prices rose to 8.7 percent from 4.2 percent.

The government has implemented a cap on rice prices to reduce costs and penalize hoarding, although this measure has sparked discussions about its impact on both farmers and consumers."
Bong Go,"""Ramdam nila na may pagbabago"" ? Bong Go defends Duterte's War on Drugs, clarifies no illegal order given",15-Oct-24,https://web.senate.gov.ph/press_release/2024/1015_go2.asp,"Senator Christopher ""Bong"" Go reaffirmed former President Rodrigo Duterte's significant impact on the Philippines through his firm stance on the war on drugs, citing overwhelming public support and recognition during his presidency.

In an ambush interview on Monday, October 14, Go pointed out that Duterte's anti-drug campaign was even met with a standing ovation during many of his State of the Nation Addresses (SONAs), as both Houses of Congress acknowledged then the positive changes it brought to the country.

""Standing ovation po ang Kongreso at ang Senado dahil ramdam nila na may pagbabago po at tinupad ni dating Pangulong Duterte ang kanyang ipinangako noon,"" Go emphasized during the interview.

""Bakit ngayon, mag-isa na lang siya? Hindi ba kayo nakinabang? Hindi ba nakinabang ang mga kababayan nating Pilipino?""

Go underscored that Duterte's presidency concluded with a high satisfaction rating. ""Bumaba si Pangulong Duterte sa MalacaÒang bilang most popular President with an excellent rating at 88% satisfaction rating,"" he said, referencing a June 2022 survey by the Social Weather Stations (SWS).

Furthermore, Go mentioned that according to Pulse Asia surveys, 88% of Filipinos supported the war on drugs in September 2017, and 69% considered eradicating the drug menace as the Duterte administration's greatest achievement as of June 2018.

Go went on to highlight the peace of mind the campaign provided to Filipinos, especially Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) who felt reassured that their families back home were safe.

Meanwhile, Go expressed his concern that the current environment might embolden criminals and drug lords. ""Ang nangyayari ngayon, lumalakas po ang loob ng mga drug lord,"" he warned.

He emphasized that it should be criminals and drug addicts who fear walking the streets at night, not ordinary citizens. ""Dapat po ang kriminal, dapat po ang drug addict ang takot maglakad sa gabi,"" Go stated, reiterating the need to continue efforts to keep communities safe.

The crime rate in the Philippines significantly dropped by 73.76% during the first five years of President Rodrigo Duterte's administration, as reported by the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG). The total number of index crimes, including murder, rape, and robbery, decreased from 131,699 in 2016 to 34,552 in 2021.

The DILG attributed the improved peace and order to the government's intensified anti-criminality programs, leading to greater public confidence in safety.

In the same interview, Go, who served as Special Assistant to the President from 2016 to October 2018 and even when Duterte was still a local official in Davao City, reiterated that he received no illegal order from the former president especially in relation to the campaign against illegal drugs.

""Abogado po si Pangulong Duterte, dati po siyang prosecutor. Hindi siya magbibigay ng instruction na iligal, so wala siyang inutusan na patayin mo ito,"" Go said.

""Kung sakali mang mayroon siyang iutos sa akin na iligal, hindi ko po ito susundin. Hindi rin po ako papayag na utusan ng iligal,"" he added.

Senator Go, in the same chance interview with Senate reporters, clarified that the former President fully supported the uniformed personnel, including the police, during his administration. He however reiterated that there was no reward system in the implementation of the drug war. The lawmaker called such allegations as ""baseless.""

""Full support po si dating Pangulong Duterte sa pulis, sa uniformed personnel. In fact, 2018, pinadoble niya po ng sahod ng pulis, military, uniformed personnel,"" Senator Go said.

Senator Go also mentioned that the former President's support to the uniformed personnel is not only limited to salary increase. Mr. Duterte likewise talked to the troops, visited those wounded in action and those who perished in action and gave aid to uniformed personnel."
Bong Go,Bong Go extends support to hundreds of impoverished residents in Samal Island,11-Nov-24,https://web.senate.gov.ph/press_release/2024/1111_go3.asp,"The Malasakit Team of Senator Christopher ""Bong"" Go, along with the local government of the Island Garden City of Samal in Davao del Norte, continues to support members of the community's indigent sector to help uplift their lives and livelihood.

Held at the Samal Island City College gym and Barangay San Isidro Gym on Saturday, November 9, a total of 700 beneficiaries received shirts, vitamins, masks, fans, basketballs, and volleyballs from Senator Go. Select recipients also received shoes, watches, and mobile phones.

Meanwhile, through the collective efforts of Go and Councilor Aldwin Jumao-as, each qualified beneficiary received financial support from the government.

Furthermore, Go, Chairperson of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography encouraged those with health issues to seek the services of the nearby Malasakit Centers located at Davao Regional Medical Center in Tagum City or at Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City.

Republic Act No. 11463, also known as the Malasakit Centers Act of 2019, for which Go was the principal sponsor and author in the Senate, led to the institutionalization of Malasakit Centers.

These centers serve as one-stop shops offering medical assistance to those requiring it in partnership with the Department of Health (DOH), the Department of Social Welfare and Development, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, and the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office. Currently, there are 166 Malasakit Centers, and according to DOH, the centers have helped over 15 million indigent patients nationwide.

Additionally, the senator is the principal sponsor and one of the authors of the recently enacted RA 11959, or the Regional Specialty Centers Act. The law mandates the establishment of Regional Specialty Centers within existing DOH regional hospitals to bring specialized medical care closer to the people.

""Patuloy kaming magseserbisyo sa inyo dahil bisyo ko ang magserbisyo at ako ay naniniwala na ang serbisyo sa tao ay serbisyo 'yan sa Panginoon, serbisyo 'yan kay Allah,"" underscored Go."
Bong Go,"Legarda: Bong Go clearly has nothing to do with frigate deal
",19-Feb-18,https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1025749,"MANILA -- Senator Loren Legarda on Monday said that it was very clear that Special Assistant to the President Christopher ?Bong? Go did not intervene in the controversial Frigate Acquisition Project (FAP) of the Philippine Navy and his appearance in the Senate is just a waste of time.

?Mr. Chairman, with all due respect, I think we are wasting the time of Sec. Bong Go sitting here because it?s very clear, wala naman siyang kinalaman dito (He is involved in this matter.),? she said during the Senate investigation into the PHP 18-billion warship deal by the Committee on National Defense and Security.

?I am not pre-judging it. All I?m saying is that ? I am calling a spade a spade,? Legarda said.

The FAP is one of the key pieces of the Armed Forces of the Philippines? modernization program, as it seeks to provide the country with the capability to deal with air, surface and sub-surface threats.

The PHP18-billion warship deal, including the weapon systems and munitions, was initiated in June 2013 and was practically completed during the time President Benigno S. Aquino III.

The contract, won by Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd (HHI), was signed only on September 2016 after President Rodrigo Duterte came into power.

However, the project was stalled in its final stages due to a contract dispute between the Navy and HHI arose over the choice of who should provide the critical combat management system (CMS) to be installed on the frigates.

Go?s name was dragged into the controversy after being accused by opposition lawmakers of ?intervening? in the selection process.

This was after the Philippine Daily Inquirer and online news outlet Rappler claimed that Go allegedly gave Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana a white paper endorsing one of the contending suppliers for the CMS.

Lorenzana attached a note to the unsigned document saying it came from Go and asked then Navy chief Ronald Mercado ?to go over it and prepare a report/rebuttal? to be submitted to the President.

Go denied giving the document to Lorenzana, which the latter confirmed.

All key players in the project also denied that Go intervened in the project

Legarda virtually debunked the allegations against the Palace official and defended the note issued by Lorenzana.

?I?ve done my homework, I?ve read all documents and all I see is this handwritten message and it?s a pro forma request of Secretary Lorenzana to look into it,? she said.

?Don?t we all do that: ?can you look into it, give me complete staff work?? Right? So we are wasting the time of people who should be working on other matters,? Legarda stressed.

She added that while she fully supports the FAP and the AFP?s modernization program, authorities involved in the process must not be disparaged just because they are doing their jobs.

?I support the Navy and its acquisition of hardware, the AFP modernization program and the faithful implementation of the Procurement Act, but also respecting the jobs and tasks of people and not casting aspersion on those who are simply doing their job in government,? Legarda said.

Nevertheless, Legarda said that the investigation should still continue to look into the bigger picture: to let everybody understand where the taxpayer?s money go and to highlight the importance of acquiring the frigates in protecting the country?s sovereignty.

The investigation, initiated by opposition lawmakers in the Senate through Resolution No. 584, seeks to determine whether the acquisition of the combat ships ""promotes the goals of the modernization program and complies with pertinent laws."" (PNA)"
Bong Go,Bong Go?s own death squad was led by Garma,27-Sep-24,https://verafiles.org/articles/bong-gos-own-death-squad-was-led-by-garma,"Last week?s House Quadcom hearings into illegal offshore gaming operations, illegal drug trade and extrajudicial killings  gave the public a picture of how powerful retired police colonel Royina Garma was during the Duterte administration and revealed her  alleged involvement in some sordid happenings.

Related to Garma?s activities, the name of Sen. Christopher Lawrence Go,  more known as Bong Go, was mentioned. The senator, however, will not be summoned because of the practice of parliamentary courtesy.

Information coming out of the Quadcom hearings affirm almost all of the revelations of self-confessed former Duterte Death Squad member Arturo LascaÒas in his 186-page affidavit submitted to the International Criminal Court and already reported by media.

To recall, LascaÒas said there were three of them, who were Duterte?s trusted insiders in the Davao Death Squad: himself, SPO4 Sonny Buenaventura, and Go who he recalls entered into the picture sometime late 1990s. ?Go was the city mayor?s trusted aide, a special assistant.?

?Later on, orders to kill were relayed through Bong Go because he was allowed to organize his own death squad. The operatives in his death squad were Police Captain Royina Garma and Police Captain Edilberto Leonardo. Garma was the station commander of the Santa Ana police station.?

?Garma?s death squad was led by SPO4 Jun CaÒete and SPO4 Paguidopon. They also had their own mass grave, in the property of CaÒete in Maa, Davao City.?

?The money that Mayor Duterte would give to Bong Go was in the millions of budget every month. Sometimes, Buenaventura and I were tasked to deliver the money to the office of Garma to finance her own death squad.? Note: In 2019, when Duterte was president, he appointed Garma as general manager of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office; she was by then elevated as Cebu City police chief after her Davao City assignment.

If what LascaÒas attests is true, Garma?s appointment tells us the extent of Duterte?s warped sense of gratitude to his trusted kill lieutenants, rewarding them with government posts even if they are unqualified for the job.

In his affidavit, LascaÒas recounted many times about the money rewards for every killing. Usually, Bong Go relayed the money to them. But why was he later given the authority to form his own death squad, apart from having Duterte?s full trust?

?Bong Go developed a very useful strategy for the killings. He was the first to use the personal information data of the targets that he had secured through an arrangement with the Land Transportation Office. Because of it, it was easy for us to find the targets. We had their addresses, their vehicle information.?

?It was because of Bong Go?s ingenuity that he was rewarded with his own death squad. The money for his death squad came from the peace and order fund and intelligence fund of the city of Davao. The other funds came from businessman Sammy Uy and Michael Yang. I knew this because it was I who was ordered by Mayor Duterte, in the presence of Michael Yang, to kidnap Philip Lam who was Yang?s business rival, in the amount of 350,000 Pesos.?

November last year, I personally interviewed LascaÒas outside the Philippines. I asked him if he agrees that Bong Go should also be prosecuted in the ICC and why. This was his reply:

?Dapat lang ma prosecute, dahil isa sya sa mga pakana sa madugo na kampanya ni Mayor Duterte against illegal drugs. Dapat managot sya sa daming mga taong namamatay sa Davao City na hindi alam ng mga kaanak, mga mahal sa buhay, kung bakit ito pinatay. Walang nag imbestiga po nito. So dapat lang sya imbestigahin at i-prosecute sa International Criminal Court.?

 ?Dapat ma prosecute sya kasama si Garma at Leonardo, dahil isa sya sa mga implementors sa drug war ni Mayor Duterte. Ang taong ito ay very dangerous sa kapangyarihan, gamit ang pera ng taong bayan.?

 LascaÒas cites two instances when Go?s own interests figured in the killings. One was the killing of Christopher Yu.

?Personal na inutusan ni Mayor Duterte si Bong Go sa harap ko, at ako din ang inutusan ni Bong Go, na ipapa-fast track ang pagpatay, pag assassinate kay Mr. Christopher Yu. Ito po si Yu ay hindi drug addict, hindi din drug user. Karibal ito sa negosyo ng stepbrother ni Bong Go. Pinapilit ni Bong Go na i-link at ilagay sa death list ni Mayor Rodrigo Duterte and pangalan ni Mr. Christopher Yu. Dahil ang kapatid kasi ni Yu na si Ryan Yu ay suspechadong lider ng mga carnapper sa Davao City.?

 ?So pinilit nya ito at nag-approve si Mayor Duterte. In fact, on the spot binigyan ako ni Bong Go ng 150,000 Pesos at yung LTO personal information data ni Mr. Christopher Yu. Kaya madali naming natunton ang bahay ni Yu at ang plaka ng kanyang sasakyan. In 3-5 days of operation, nabaril si Christopher Yu ng isa sa mga death squad na hawak ko na si PO2 Reynante Medina. Patay si Christopher Yu sa loob ng kanyang sasakyan at nangdoon yata ang kanyang mga anak na sinundo nya sa eskwelahan at that time.?

?At isa pa na inutos ni Bong Go ay patayin si Mr. Odchimar. Hindi rin ito addict at hindi ito drug lord dahil may-ari ito ng isang security agency sa Davao City. Patay si Mr. Odchimar at binaril din ito ni Medina at ako ang kanyang perimeter security back-up at that time.?

 ?Marami pa ang mga patayan sa Davao City na si Bong Go ang may pakana ginamit ang Land Transportation Office personal information data ng mga target personalities na nasa death list ang kanilang mga pangalan kay Mayor Duterte.?

Bong Go,The rise of Bong Go,11-May-19,https://www.abs-cbn.com/news/05/11/19/the-rise-of-bong-go,"MANILA ? As the campaign season for administration-backed bets kicked off in the packed grounds of Pampanga?s provincial capitol, Christopher Lawrence ?Bong? Go took the stage and bowed before the audience before taking the podium.

That Go chose to bow as he got up on stage was no coincidence. He was mimicking his long-time boss, President Rodrigo Duterte, who would often make the same gesture during public speaking engagements.

For those at the event who have been closely monitoring Philippine politics, there was no doubt in their minds that Go is Duterte?s single most important candidate in the upcoming senatorial elections.

Go, who served as the former Davao City mayor?s aide for over two decades, stayed on the sidelines when his boss rose to the presidency.

But Duterte attracted so much attention and interest that Go also found himself in the limelight. From being the ?national photobomber? and ?selfie king,? he is now gunning for a Senate seat and has a good chance of winning, if the surveys are to be believed.

?Hindi ko po ito ine-expect. Pero siguro ito ay dahil sa tiwala ng taumbayan kay Pangulong Duterte at sa pangakong ipagpapatuloy namin ang kampanya laban sa ilegal na droga, korupsyon at kriminalidad,? Go said of his rise in the during a chance interview on the sidelines of a campaign event in Davao City on May 9.

(I was not expecting this. But maybe this is because of the people?s trust in President Duterte and my promise to continue his campaign against drugs, corruption, and criminality.)

'METEORIC RISE'
University of the Philippines political science department head Ela Atienza said Duterte?s all-out support was the crucial ingredient for Go?s meteoric rise in the pre-election surveys, noting that the political neophyte has no track record to bank on.

?Wala naman tayong alam about Bong Go except that he is with the President. That?s the only thing we know about him. He is the only one banking on being attached to the President,? Atienza told ABS-CBN News.

Go only had a 5.9 percent voter preference in the March 2018 survey of Pulse Asia. About a week before the May 13 elections, this figure rose to 42 percent, making go one of the frontrunners in the senatorial race.

UP political professor Aries Arugay said it would be ?embarrassing? for the popular Duterte if Go ?will not win and will not win big.?

?[Duterte] has been campaigning for Bong Go even before and it seemed like the entire machinery of the Philippine state is behind him. This is to compensate to the fact that he?s a newcomer compared to the others,? Arugay told ABS-CBN News.

?What Go has is his direct access to the President. So somehow, that is residual. Anything that the people think positive of Duterte he gets a residue of it by virtue of his proximity.?

But Go and his team of strategists knew that constant media exposure and closeness to the President were not enough to seal a victory in a Senate race teeming with old and familiar names in Philippine politics.

Even before the start of the official campaign period in February this year, Go?s posters and billboards were scattered all over the country.

The Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism said Go led the candidates with the biggest pre-campaign season spending. It said Go spent P422 million in ads from January 2018 to January 2019, dwarfing his declared net worth of P12.8 million.

Go has distanced himself from the campaign materials posted prior to the start of the campaign period in February.

He has also downplayed the PCIJ report, saying only campaign materials used during the 3-month campaign period beginning February 12 should be computed as part of his political expenses.

?Masyadong bloated at masyadong malicious. Napaka-malicious nung report,? he told reporters on the sidelines of PDP-Laban?s campaign kickoff in San Jose Del Monte, Bulacan last Feb. 14.

(The amount was too bloated, too malicious. The report is too malicious.)

?Ang mga supporters ko ang nag-place ng ads; iyung iba nga po libre. Hindi ko po alam bakit umabot ng ganoon. Hindi ko po maiwasan, marami kaming supporters ni Pangulong Duterte na sila mismo ang naglalagay ng ads.?

(It was my supporters who placed the ads; some are even free. I don?t know why it reached that amount. That can?t be avoided because President Duterte and I have supporters who placed the ads themselves.)

Monitoring campaign expenses prior to the official campaign period has been a challenge for the Commission on Elections (Comelec).

A Supreme Court?s decision in 2009 in the Penera vs Comelec case rendered the poll body toothless in going after those who conduct premature campaigning.

Because of the SC ruling, any TV, radio or newspaper advertisements released prior to the actual campaign period are not prohibited. Thus, any expenses incurred for partisan activities prior to the campaign period won?t be included in the computation for campaign expenses.

Go has managed to avoid major controversies during the campaign period. Opposition bet Gary Alejano earlier accused Go of using government funds for his campaign when he distributed shirts during a public assembly attended by barangay officials, but this failed to pull the latter?s numbers down.

Bong Go shirts distributed in paid Liga ng mga Barangay event
Go, for his part, insisted that no government resources were used in his campaign.

?If government funds were used, don?t vote for me,? he said in a chance interview in Pampanga on Feb. 12, the start of the campaign period.

He has also succeeded in evading hard questions about his candidacy by avoiding televised public debates."

If alleged threats from the camp of Vice President Leni Robredo were true to sow ?possible terrorist action? in the event Ferdinand Marcos Jr. wins in the May 9 elections, then communist elements may have infiltrated the campaign of the country?s No. 2 official.

Jayvee Hinlo,Senatorial bet Jayvee Hinlo leads pro-Duterte rally in Bacolod,13-Mar-25,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/visayas/senatorial-bet-jayvee-hinlo-leads-pro-duterte-rally-bacolod/,"NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, Philippines ? Supporters of ex-president Rodrigo Duterte staged a noise barrage and rally in Bacolod City on Wednesday night, March 12, denouncing his arrest and transfer to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, Netherlands a day earlier.

The protest, led by senatorial candidate Jesus ?Jayvee? Hinlo Jr., deputy secretary general for the Visayas of the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino (PDP), drew an estimated 2,500 people to a candlelight and prayer rally at the Bacolod City Government Center, according to city police director Colonel Joeresty Coronica.

A motorcade of over 100 motorcycles and vehicles wound through the city, with participants blaring their horns. Coronica described the demonstration as ?orderly and peaceful? but said police remain on alert for any further protests.

?The crowd is unbelievable. It shows that many in Bacolod still love Tatay Digong,? said Hinlo, who served as undersecretary at the Department of the Interior and Local Government, board member of the Land Bank of the Philippines, and commissioner of the Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission during Duterte?s presidency. His candidacy received support from Duterte.

Protesters expressed their solidarity with Duterte, who was arrested upon his return from Hong Kong on Tuesday, March 11. The former leader faces trial at the ICC over alleged crimes against humanity related to his bloody war on drugs.

Duterte?s war on drugs, launched after he took office in 2016, led to thousands of deaths in police operations and vigilante-style killings. Human rights groups estimate that more than 30,000 people, mostly from poor communities, were killed. The campaign drew international condemnation, with the ICC opening an investigation into alleged extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions, and other abuses. 

Pastor David Bob Carillo of the Redeemer?s Missionary Baptist Church in Barangay Sum-ag said joining the rally was ?the best thing I can do to show opposition to the present administration.? He then prayed for Duterte.

?Walang iwanan!? said Bacolod-based lawyer John Deles. He rejected Duterte?s arrest, asserting that the former president was denied due process.

But many also do not support Duterte in Bacolod and Negros Occidental. Former Negros Occidental governor Rafael Coscolluela, for instance, took to social media: ?Above all the noise resulting from his arrest, please remember one thing ? he is being accorded due process. Exactly what ?tokhang? victims were deprived of.?

The Human Rights Advocates Negros (HRAN) said Duterte?s arrest marks a step toward justice for Rafael Atotubo, a 62-year-old trial lawyer who was gunned down in front of his house at the corner of AB PareÒo and Galo streets in Bacolod on August 23, 2018.

Atotubo, a member of the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG), was known for defending suspects in Bacolod and other parts of Negros Occidental facing drug-related charges.

His murder remains unsolved, but rights groups suspect it was part of the extrajudicial killings  linked to Duterte?s war on drugs.

HRAN has also attributed the murders of human rights lawyer Benjamin Ramos in Kabankalan City in 2018, Escalante Councilor and rights advocate Bernardino ?Toto? Patigas in 2019, and Negros Island Health Integrated Program officer Zara Alvarez in Bacolod in 2020 to the wave of EJKs under Duterte?s administration.

Like Atotubo?s case, the killings of Ramos, Patigas, and Alvarez remain unsolved.

The pocket rallies in Mindanao and Visayas were mostly led by politicians aspiring for different positions. In Cebu, local candidates allied with the Dutertes, staged similar pocket rallies to decry the former president?s arrest.

On Tuesday, Cebu gubernatorial aspirant Pam Baricuatro led a prayer rally for Duterte at the Plaza Independencia.

In Lapu-Lapu City, mayoral aspirant Paz Radaza and congressional aspirant Ryan Yuson led a Mass for Duterte, followed by a motorcade in Cordova town, on Wednesday. "

Former senator Gringo Honasan said he has ?no regrets, always lessons learned? in running without a slate for the 2025 senatorial elections under the Reform PH People?s Party.

The remark came in response to a question at a news forum in San Juan City on Friday about his exclusion from President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.?s Alyansa para sa Bagong Pilipinas (Alliance for the New Philippines) slate despite running under his Uniteam slate in 2022.

When asked if he had any regrets about Uniteam, Honasan said, ?No. I have no regrets in what I do in my life but always lessons learned.?

?They included me because the platform was unity. What happened now? I was not included? If this administration slate is a derivative of the Uniteam, what unity are we showing to our people, especially to our children? That?s my concern,? he added.

Gringo Honasan,Sandiganbayan orders arrest of Honasan over P30M pork barrel scam,10-Aug-17,https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1005684,"MANILA, Aug. 10 -- The Sandiganbayan has ordered the arrest of Senator Gregorio ?Gringo? Honasan in connection with the alleged PHP30 million pork barrel fund scam.

The anti-graft court issued the warrant of arrest for  violation of Republic Act No. 3019, or the ?Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act?, which was filed by the Office of the Ombudsman?s (Ombudsman) Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) against Honasan.

?The Court finds that there is sufficient probable cause to hold the accused in this case for trial and issue a warrant of arrest for them,? the Sandiganbayan Second Division resolution said.

?After perusing the information and carefully evaluating the Joint Resolution dated Aug 9, 2016 and Joint Order dated April 12, 2017 both of the Office of the Ombudsman, as well as the supporting evidence, conformably with Section 5(a), Rule 112 of the Rules of Court, the Court finds that there is sufficient probable cause to hold the accused in this case for trial and issue a warrant of arrest against them,? the resolution added.

Likewise, ordered arrested are Honasan?s coordinator Michael Benjamin and former officials of the National Council for Muslim Filipino (NCMF) Mehol Sadain, Fedelina Aldanese, Galay Makalinggan, Aurora Aragon-Mabang and Olga Galido.

Also included in the case are  Focus Development Goals Foundation, Inc. officials Giovanni Manuel Gaerlan and Salvador Gaerlan.

Honasan allotted his Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) to the NCMF, but it was found there was an alleged anomalous utilization of the PDAF.

Department of Budget and Management (DBM) records show that Honasan's PHP30 million PDAF was released in 2012. (PNA)"
Gringo Honasan,Palace releases Honasan?s appointment paper as new DICT chief,22-Nov-18,https://www.pna.gov.ph/index.php/articles/1054605,"MANILA -- MalacaÒang on Thursday released the appointment paper of Senator Gregorio ?Gringo? Honasan II, two weeks after he accepted President Rodrigo Duterte?s offer to head the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT).

Duterte signed Honasan?s appointment paper on Nov. 20, making him the second senator to get a Cabinet portfolio under the present administration.

In May 2017, Duterte appointed Senator Alan Peter Cayetano as foreign affairs chief but the latter eventually resigned to run as congressman of Taguig City in the 2019 mid-term polls.

With Honasan?s appointment, the Senate will now be left with only 22 members, including detained Senator Leila de Lima, who is facing illegal drugs-related charges.

Honasan, a former military colonel, replaced acting DICT Secretary Eliseo Rio Jr.

Under Rio?s supervision, Mislatel, a consortium composed of Udenna Corp. and Chelsea Logistics headed by Davao businessman Dennis Uy and China Telecom, got the government?s approval to become the country?s third major telco player.

Mislatel will compete with Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT) Inc. and Globe Telecom.

Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said Duterte appointed Honasan based on ?trust and confidence and integrity?.

He said questions on the 70-year-old lawmaker?s competence in the field of information and communication will be up to the Commission on Appointments (CA), a congressional body.

?It is not for us to decide on that. It will be the Commission on Appointments. There will be vetting and he?ll have to respond to the questions on his competence,? Panelo said in a Palace press briefing on Thursday.

The submission will seek to request a leave for the court to address the validity of Duterte?s arrest and the ?urgent need? to release and return him to the Philippines.

?We are publicly asking all candidates, national and local, to join us here and turn this into a national issue,? Honasan said at a press conference at the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman in Quezon City.

Gringo Honasan,"Honasan, a key player in EDSA revolution, is part of Marcos-Duterte slate
",4-Feb-22,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/elections/gringo-honasan-part-marcos-jr-sara-duterte-senate-slate-2022/,"MANILA, Philippines ? Former senator and information secretary Gringo Honasan II, a retired soldier who played a key role in the 1986 People Power Revolution that ousted the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, has joined the senatorial slate of Marcos? son, Ferdinand Jr.

Marcos announced this in a statement on Friday, February 4, making Honasan the 11th person to be in his slate with running mate Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte.

?We are pleased that he is now part of our senatorial slate. We believe that Senator Gringo will accomplish a lot in the Senate, coming up with laws that will help ensure better lives for our countrymen,? Marcos said.

Honasan was Juan Ponce Enrile?s aide-de-camp during the martial law years, and was a member of the Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM).

RAM is a group of soldiers first founded by young officers in response to corruption in the Philippine military during the late dictator Marcos? regime. The group continued to stage coups against Marcos? successor, Corazon Aquino.

For their attempts to overthrow the Aquino administration, they were charged with rebellion and arrested. Honasan himself was granted amnesty by Aquino?s successor, Fidel Ramos, in 1992. 

Honasan was also a leader of the 2004 Oakwood Mutiny against former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, whose Lakas-CMD is carrying the vice presidential bid of Sara Duterte.

In 2016 when he ran for vice president against Marcos, Honasan said he believes that the sins of the dictator should not be blamed on the son.

Honasan is running for the Senate as an independent candidate. The Marcos-Duterte Uniteam so far has eleven in their slate, and is set to complete the 12-person lineup in time for their proclamation rally on February 8, also the start of the official campaign period.


Reform Party endorses Marcos-Duterte
The Reform Party, described as an offshoot of Honasan?s RAM, has also endorsed Marcos and Duterte.

?In a resolution issued on January 21, 2022, but was made public on Friday, February 4, 2022, signed by its president James A. Layug and other key officials, the party resolved to declare their support for the candidacies of Bongbong and Inday Sara,? said the Marcos camp in a statement.

Layug is a former member of the Magdalo group. Magdalo?s Antonio Trillanes IV is running for the Senate and is supporting opposition leader Vice Presidewnt Leni Robredo.

Reform, in October 2021, endorsed the candidacy of longtime Duterte aide Bong Go, who was then running for vice president under PDP-Laban. Reform did not endorse Senator Ronald dela Rosa even if he was the PDP-Laban presidential candidate at that time.

Go initially withdrew his vice presidential bid to run for president under another party, the obscure Pederalismo ng Dugong Dakilang Samahan, only to withdraw that candidacy later on. 

PDP-Laban has since ?adopted? Duterte?s daughter and Marcos Jr?s running-mate Sara as their vice president, but has thus far not picked a presidential candidate.

President Rodrigo Duterte himself has not endorsed a presidential candidate."
Gringo Honasan,"?Where Is Gringo?? Filipinos Ask : Once Hero, Now Hunted: Honasan Haunts a Nation","Sept. 1, 1987",https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-09-01-mn-5349-story.html,"MANILA ? More than a decade ago, a young, idealistic Philippine army lieutenant named Gregorio Honasan was deeply concerned about the credibility of the armed forces as they battled thousands of armed Muslim secessionists on the southern island of Mindanao.

Honasan wanted to prove that body counts of enemy dead were accurate and not government propaganda, so he ordered his men to cut off the ears of each enemy soldier they killed and deliver them to their commander on a string.

?Then we told them, ?Just divide by two,? ? Honasan said with a smile.

Today, Honasan?s enemy is President Corazon Aquino, and that anecdote, related to The Times by now-Col. Honasan when he was still a national hero a year ago, reveals the ruthlessness as well as the depth of commitment of a man who is now the object of one of the biggest manhunts in Philippine history.

Honasan, known to almost every Filipino as Gringo, a nickname often given to men named Gregorio, has gone from hero to haunter in a year?s time.

At age 38, Honasan was the chief planner and executor of the February, 1986, rebellion that drove then-President Ferdinand E. Marcos into exile and brought Aquino to power. The nation instantly worshiped the ruggedly handsome combat veteran, who appeared on the cover of national magazines with an Uzi submachine gun over his shoulder and a confident smile on his face. Teen-age boys pursued him for autographs, and girls taped his photograph to the walls of their rooms.

Four days ago, Honasan tried it again. He and a band of rebellious troops, most of them the same military ideologues who took part in the uprising against Marcos, seized the same Defense Ministry building in the same military camp and issued the same appeal to fellow officers and men to join them in the interest of the nation?s future.

Disappeared Into Jungle

This time, Honasan failed. As loyalist Aquino forces led by Honasan?s former ally, armed forces Chief of Staff Fidel V. Ramos, were crushing his rebellion last Friday, Honasan fled Manila in a helicopter and disappeared into the labyrinth of mountains and jungles somewhere north of the capital.

The fact that Honasan is still alive and free has left the nation ill at ease, almost certain that the fierce young soldier--who is best known to Filipinos for parachuting into Muslim war zones with a pet cobra he called ?Tiffany? draped around his neck--will try again.

Aquino has directed the military to issue shoot-on-sight orders for Honasan and his fellow rebel commanders, among them Lt. Col. Tito Legaspi. Presidential aides have declared publicly that they want Honasan dead. And for a nation that thrives on war-movie heroes who inspire awe and terror, the question on most lips this week is: ?Where is Gringo??


Sensing the danger that Honasan could become an even more charismatic folk hero, a rebel with a cause in a culture that admires defiance, Aquino and Ramos both have launched a drive to discredit him and his men.

?Why is Gringo so glorified up to now?? Ramos, 60, growled to reporters Saturday as he toured the damaged camp that the rebels had used as their base. ?He?s a traitor. He is a big liar. He lied to his officers, he lied to his men and he lied to his country. He abandoned his men. He misled them, telling them they were going on a training mission. And he lied to the people, telling them he was for the people and then killing so many innocent civilians.?

Aquino has gone even further. In a speech to senior military commanders Sunday, she branded Honasan and his men as ?cowardly? murderers and defined the drama now being played out in the wake of the coup as a personal conflict between herself, as the force of good, and Honasan and his men as the ?forces of dictatorship and darkness.?

Personalizing even more the psychological battle with her now-invisible opponent, Aquino declared, ?The aim of the rebels was clearly to kill the president and her family.?

Although the killing of loyalist soldiers by Honasan?s rebels alienated many key military officers and men who might have been tempted to join Honasan last week, it is not clear that the government?s campaign to discredit Honasan is working on a civilian population that loves melodrama.

At least two major daily newspapers have responded positively to the anti-Honasan drive. The pro-Aquino Philippine Inquirer ran a front-page headline Sunday declaring ?Gringo a Coward,? and the respected Manila Chronicle published a story Monday that quoted Sen. Rene Saguisag, a former presidential adviser, as saying: ?The Gringo of today is not the Gringo of the other day. Gringo doesn?t smell like roses anymore.?

The Chronicle story concluded: ?In a manner of speaking, Col. Gregorio (Gringo) Honasan is dead, the myth and mystique of a professional soldier that he wove around his person shattered by the coup he led last Friday.?

Yet far more newspapers were filled with romanticized accounts of Honasan?s ?daring escape? from the ?clutches? of Ramos? loyalist troops. According to most accounts, Honasan and Legaspi fled by helicopter at the height of the government?s combined air strike and artillery barrage on the rebel stronghold.

And, from bank clerks and stockbrokers to taxi drivers and street vendors, dozens of civilians have told The Times that they see the entire war of words as an internal military conflict, a battle between an idealistic, colorful and now-hunted renegade officer and a tough, cigar-chomping, by-the-book chief of staff."

UniTeam senatorial aspirant Gregorio ""Gringo"" Honasan II declined to comment on the statements of his fellow candidates in the slate denying Martial Law abuses, but he maintained that these happened.

He said there were abuses in the brutal regime of the dictator Ferdinand Marcos, but added that this was ""just like in any other administration."" The elder Marcos ruled as a dictator from 1972 to 1981 and kept most of the powers he had under Martial Law despite it being officially lifted. 


A government Human Rights Victims? Claims Board tallied and awarded reparations to victims and kin in 11,103 cases of rights violations done between 1972 and 1986.

A former soldier, Honasan was among the prominent figures in the 1986 People Power Revolution that toppled the dictatorship of Marcos, but he also took part in coup attempts during the succeeding administration of Corazon Aquino.


In his bid to return to the Senate in the 2022 polls, Honasan is in the slate of the dictator?s son and presidential candidate Ferdinand ?Bongbong? Marcos Jr., where he shares the ticket with suspended lawyer Larry Gadon, a loyalist who repeatedl denies abuses during the Martial Law.

""I cannot pass judgment on the statements of fellow candidates. Let?s allow history and the Filipino people and divine providence to judge all of us and history,"" Honasan said in a chance interview in a UniTeam Bulacan event on Tuesday.

The Marcos family and their allies have long been accused of revising history. Fact-checking coalition Tsek.ph reported that ""attempts to erase of burnish the discreditable record of Marcos are seen through various forms of disinformation through social media platforms.""

'Breakdown in control systems'
Asked what he would tell a young Filipino about what happened during Martial Law, Honasan noted that ""just like any other administration, there are abuses.""


Honasan said no system is perfect. ?The idea really, there will be abuses, there will be corruption, but it?s basically a breakdown. I?m not justifying corruption or abuses but just like any other system, right, it?s not perfect so it?s a breakdown in control systems,? he added.

The Marcos dictatorship, however, saw 3,240 people killed, 70,000 jailed and 34,000 tortured. Grave violations of human rights were also recorded in the regime, while the family's loot is pegged at hundreds of billions.

'Who does not like unity?'
But for the 2022 national polls, Honasan said he believes in the ""unity"" campaign by Marcos Jr.

""If you look at all the platforms or programs of different groups and parties, who does not like unity? Who does not want anti-corruption, housing? So these are the things that allowed these groups to adopt me as an independent,"" he added.

Marcos has been criticized for not presenting a detailed platform, as he instead focuses on his unity campaign in public speeches. He has also been questioned on how he will ?unite? victims of his father?s regime, but the aspirant said he will just win them over with his good programs and sincerity."

In the Bakit Ikaw: The DZRH Job Interview on Tuesday, Honasan revealed that his platforms focus on securing the basic needs of the people, including food, clothing, shelter, health, education, and information.

""Marami tayong kailangan tapusin na trabaho. Hindi na ako nangangako magbuhat noong tumakbo tayo noon sa unang pagkakataon noong 1995 dahil lahat ng pangako ko noon ay ginawa ko na at ipinagpatuloy ko,"" Honasan stated.

""Ang plataporma natin ay seguridad, seguridad ng may pagkain, pabahay, may pambili ng gamot, pampadala sa hospital, pantustos ng tuition at may bago ngayon, impormasyon ? hindi ?yung marites ah ? mabilisan na pagkalat ng katotohanan,"" he added.

The senatorial aspirant believes that it is crucial to digitize all aspects of the government and that the government's knowledge and capabilities must be elevated to fully embrace digitalization.

Honasan, who served as the Secretary of the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) during the Duterte administration, aims to continue the initiatives he began in the department if he secures a seat in the Senate.

Issues in the West Philippine Sea

The former senator reiterated that the West Philippine Sea (WPS) legally, geographically, and historically belongs to the Philippines.

He further stated that while China continues its provocative actions against the Philippines through aggressive moves towards Filipinos, the country should prepare and remain unshaken.

""Kung hindi natin kayang protektahan ?yung mangingisda natin na nangingisda para pakainin at suportahan ?yung mga pamilya nila na maaaring magutom, anong klaseng Republika o bansa tayo?"" said Honasan.

Moreover, Honasan supports the deployment of U.S. Typhoon missiles in the country, noting that it is a strategic move by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.

However, he mentioned that the country should not depend on other nation's help but instead prepare its own strategy.

""Kailangan may plano tayo. Ang sinasabi natin sa gobyerno, sa Pangulo, isama naman ninyo kaming mamamayan sa plano ninyo para magkakasama tayong ipagtanggol itong demokrasya natin,"" Honasan explained.

""Ilang dekada, ilang daang taon nating pinaghirapan na makamit natin ang kalayaan, dahil lang may bully sa harap natin, ibibigay na natin?"" he added.

On the matter of foreign spies, Honasan pointed out that securing relevant data is crucial in addressing the issue.

He suggested that as soon as foreigners arrive in the country, their identities should immediately be known, along with their destinations and the reasons for their visit.

Alleged destabilization efforts against the Marcos administration

Honasan stated that the country should focus on achieving inclusive growth, rather than destabilization, as there is nothing to gain from such actions.

""Ang hamon sa ating lahat, hindi lamang sa gobyerno, kung papaano mararamdaman ang pag-angat ng ekonomiyang ito doon sa mga kababayan natin na kumakain sa basurahan. ?Yun ang inclusive growth. ?Yun ang asikasuhin natin hindi ?yung destabilization. Wala tayong mapapala diyan,"" said Honasan.

He then reiterated that the country?s budget should be open and transparent, as it is the taxpayers? money.

""Kung transparent, walang tinatago, siguro walang kwestyon iyan,"" he added.

President Marcos previously stated that the allegations of blanks and discrepancies in the 2025 national budget are merely part of the ongoing destabilization efforts against the government.

Extending assistance to Filipinos

Honasan mentioned that national priorities and data are key to ensuring quick intervention and prompt government assistance.

Issue of corruption in the country

The former Senator acknowledged that completely eliminating corruption is impossible, but it can be controlled and reduced.

""Yang corruption pwedeng i-control 'yan at bawasan, pero kung sasabihing burahin ?yung corruption ay tao lang tayo. Hindi ko sinasabing tama 'yan. Para mas marami ?yung napupunta sa serbisyo, food, clothing, shelter, education, health, at data kaysa doon sa under the table,"" Honasan mentioned.

He suggested that increasing the salaries of government employees would help prevent them from being tempted or forced to steal from the public funds.

""Ito ang mensahe at panalangin ko para sa taumbayan, isang bandera, one flag, one nation, one people together, patuloy tayong mangarap pero tapatan natin ng dasal. Dream hard, pray hard, at work hard. Para maitaguyod natin itong pinagpalang bansa natin,"" he said in closing.

Honasan served as a senator for 21 years and later became a cabinet member in the previous administration, holding the position of DICT Secretary."

Ping Lacson,Lacson vows review of Free Tertiary Education Act if elected,4/14/2025,https://www.inquirer.net/436485/lacson-vows-review-of-free-tertiary-education-act-if-elected/,"MANILA, Philippines ó If elected, former Sen. Panfilo ìPingî Lacson has vowed to push for a review of  or the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act or the Free Tertiary Education Act as he saw the need to reduce requirements imposed on students. Lacson, in a statement on Monday, said he received information from free tertiary education applicants that some have faced difficulty meeting requirements under the current law. The former senator is seeking a Senate return, running under the administration-backed Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas. ìWe will revisit the Free Tertiary Education Act and streamline it if needed. If the information is true that many requirements are imposed on applicants, it indicates the program does not want beneficiaries. The requirements may need to be simplified,î Lacson said in an interview in Pangasinan, transcripts of which were sent to reporters. ìThe law decrees that it be simple. Could it be that the implementing rules are complicated? We must revisit it and if needed, make the needed amendments. So we will visit the Free Tertiary Education Act,î he added. According to Republic Act No. 10931, Filipino students can avail of free tertiary education in public school institutions if they meet the following requirements:pass the entrance examination and admission and retention requirements of the state university and colleges (SUCs), local universities and colleges (LUCs), or technical-vocational institution (TVIs), have no existing bachelorís degree or its equivalent, have Filipino citizenship, finish the degree on time, enroll in the required units per year. Lacson said that the examinations for the free tertiary education must be competitive so that it will not be abused ó noting that the government needs to ensure that people will not use connections to some politicians just to benefit from the law. ìIf they become beneficiaries through that route, they are likely to keep failing because they are not motivated to study well,î he said. The administration has vowed to continue supporting free tertiary education, with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. saying last March 2024 that education remains the governmentís highest priority."
Ping Lacson,Leadership by example is key,1/6/2022,https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/01/25/2156116/leadership-example-key,"MANILA, Philippines ó Leading contenders for the presidency share their views on a number of issues in one-on-one interviews with ìAsiaís King of Talkî Boy Abunda.

Sen. Panfilo Lacson kicks off the presidential interviews, which made sure that the candidates answered the same questions and were given equal time to answer them.

The STAR will be carrying excerpts from the Abunda interviews starting today.

Panfilo Morena Lacson Sr. Partido Para sa Demokratikong Reporma
As PNP chief I was able to fight corruption, and as a senator, I am still doing this. Thatís why I have many enemies in the Senate. I block insertions. I donít get pork barrel.

On mining & the environment
Where do you stand on the issue of sustainable versus a total ban on mining? Why?
The bottom line is responsible mining. It should address the issues on the environment. We cannot kill mining because it is a major industry. Decisions should be data-driven and science-based, not just for mining.

There are many violations committed in small-scale mining. There is the problem of bureaucracy and corruption, if somebody gives lagay (bribery). they give permits. Thereís the palakasan system and the problem of implementation.

Thatís where we need environmentalists and NGOs who are always watching.

There should be a single standard for all miners. Leadership by example is important. And implementation. We need to put the peopleís trust back in government.

On COVID-19 and the pandemic
Given the unpredictability and viciousness of this virus, what would be your program to combat COVID-19?
First, thereís a need to be pro-active. Remember the Wuhan couple who boarded domestic flights here ñ thatís when the virus began to spread.

We in the Senate asked if the authorities were able to monitor and do contract tracing. They said they were able to trace only 17% . We didnít ban the Chinese tourists from entering because it was said China is our friend and they bring in business.

And with the Omicron, we knew what was happening in Europe and America, but we were only reacting, rather than doing something to prevent it. When businesses offered to take care of their employeesí vaccination, the LGUs reacted by saying they would take care of it. The thing is, thereís no tradeoff between health and economy. Put the right persons in the right positions. Either a health background or a finance man.

The first thing we need is internal cleansing. I did this in PNP. You canít start from the outside. We have 1.4 Million government officials. I donít care if only 500 thousand remain as long as theyíre honest and hardworking.

Yes, the Covid handling of this government is a failure.

On poverty
How will you deal with the urgent problems of joblessness and hunger in the country if you become President?
The problem here is corruption. Instead of the government spending on social services, livelihood and infrastructure, money goes to the pockets of a few.

To lift the people from poverty, instead of giving just dole-outs, we should harness their skills so they can be productive citizens. So it should not just be pantawid ñ but pang-ahon sa kahirapan.

This dole-out mentality prevails, especially during elections.

I asked my staff to check, and I have saved the government about P300 billion during the past 18 years.

On corruption
Yes, 20 percent of the national budget, which is around P700 billion, goes to corruption. From 2010 to 2020, the unused budget was P328 billion per year. Imagine if this was used for productive endeavors! Poor planning.

As PNP chief I was able to fight corruption, and as senator I am still doing it. Thatís why I have many enemies in the Senate. I block insertions. I donít get pork barrel. Pork barrel per se is not bad. But the perception is that those who use it get commissions. That is why I decided not to use it.

On OFW/Migrants
How will you balance the economic contribution of OFWs and the unquantifiable social cost of migration?
There should be government intervention. We call them the new heroes, but do we treat them like heroes? We donít even have a retirement program for them when they come back to the Philippines. Itís good that a department has been created to handle OFWs, but again we have to watch the implementation

As for the unquantifiable social cost of migration that leads to the destruction of families, the world has become smaller because of modern communication technology. We can use that not only for the OFW but also for those nangungulila, those left behind.

On social media, proliferation of pornography
How will you handle the issue of cyberporn?
Basic education starts at home, but parents may be too busy working and they donít realize their child is into cyber pornography. Professional help from psychiatrists must be sought here.

We should have a government agency focusing on this problem, especially since our country has become the number one porn hub. Again, we have to be proactive rather than reactive. There is also a disconnect between our government leaders and the citizenry because they have lost respect and trust in our government. This trust cannot be demanded, it has to be earned.

So the government should be strong-willed; It should have one standard; it should set an example.

On rape-related abortion
Is it time to enact a law on abortion that would allow pregnant rape victims the choice of legal and safe abortion?
Should we enact a law that would allow pregnant rape victims the choice of legal and safe abortions?

I will be honest, Iím not prepared to answer this question because I donít have enough data on this. I have first to know the far-reaching implications.

On a personal level, my instinctive response is we should not abort. And with government intervention, we should provide help in raising the child, and in reducing the trauma of the mother.

On drugs
Are we already a narco country? What is your program to counter the drug problem?
I donít think we have reached that point where we are a narco country. We are still far from being a Mexico or Colombia. Duterte ran on a platform of anti-illegal drugs and he won. But he should not have set a self-imposed deadline. The thing is, the government focused on law enforcement. They forget the prevention and rehabilitation aspects. Senate President Sotto and I discussed this, and he said, leave this problem to me, I know how to handle it. He was once the Dangerous Drugs Board chairman. And he authored the Dangerous Drugs Act and the amendatory laws.

There should be demand-reduction and supply-reduction on drugs. Where do the drugs come from? Customs! We catch 10 kilos, 100 kilos,but how much goes through Customs! The enforcers are able to catch here and there but how much are they not able to catch? Again, corruption!

On Philippine debt
If you win as President of the Philippines, how will you tackle the payment of our national debt?
To pay for our debt, we need to balance our budget. Meaning, whatever we just need for our economy to move, give social services and livelihood, letís stick to that. Why does our debt go up every year? (As of November 2021, itís 11.93 Trillion pesos). We should first of all get rid of the unused amount in our budget. Remove the wastages. Two targets: Expenditure side and revenue side. Stop corruption so we can have more revenue. A grandfather was imprisoned for days for stealing mangoes from his neighbor. But those who stole millions and continue to steal millions go around with police escorts and bodyguards.

Yes, we should put them in jail. I will start with those who I know are obviously corrupt and nobody will complain. Of course there is due process. The ordinary thieves, they get the whip surely and fast. But the big-time thieves, they stay big, they stay powerful.


Sen. Ping Lacson raises the Philippine flag on Pag-Asa Island on Nov. 20, 2021, days after Chinese coast guard ships blocked and water-cannoned Philippine boats on a resupply mission to a military outpost in Ayungin Shoal.
On the West Philippine Sea
If all diplomatic efforts fail, as president, do you think the Philippines is strong enough and prepared to fight a defensive war against China to protect our territorial soil?
No. Thatís the reason why we have to strengthen our alliances with the equally militarily strong countries like the US, European Union countries, Australia. These are countries with their own interests in the West Philippine Sea. Kasi hindi natin kaya talaga. Very weak tayo militarily. We have weapons in our arsenal that we have not tapped. Mutual defense treaty. Itís there. An assault on a public vessel of either country is an assault to the sovereignty of either party. So for me, balance of power in the West Philippine Sea. I went to Pag-asa Island, I talked to the (Wescom) commander, the American warship tried to enter the area which China insists is theirs and no one can enter.

When they were challenged, the warship captain said: The right of innocent passage. Hindi sila ginalaw. (They were untouched.)

That means they couldnít attack or water-cannon the Americans. So balance of power. Foreign policy is always anchored on national interest. That cannot be denied. May national interest sila diyan. First of all, freedom of navigation. If China controls,the freedom of navigation will be gone.

The decision of the arbitral court, although not enforceable, is permanent. But that ruling cannot be solved by war. It can be resolved through international pressure.

We have always been bullied by China. When I went to Pag-asa as a senator, we were being challenged, we heard the pilot say pwede namin kayo bombahin (we can have you bombed). You know what was on my mind? Mamatay na kung mamatay! (I will die if I have to!) It would be a shame for me, a Philippine senator, to back out. We were challenged. This is ours.

On presidential qualifications
Is it high time to amend the Constitution on the qualifications to run for President of the country?
We should amend the qualifications. We have to raise them. We have to amend the Constitution. Especially now as you said, the duties are daunting, during this pandemic.

But of course, bottom line is, itís up to the people to decide. Vox populi, vox dei. Maybe itís time for our voters to be more discerning. They should not be swayed by the politics of entertainment. Letís shift to serious politics. Voters are swayed by factors like, who gave the bigger dole-out. So sadÖRegarding entertainment. Thatís where my campaign team and I disagree ó they want you to dance. But I have a threshold on that. Weíre facing serious problems that need solutions. I can as long as my authenticity is not sacrificed. I can be pliant but only up to a certain point.

The number one problem of our country is government. And the solution is government. Of course, the Constitution is saying we shouldnít look at class. Kahit hindi nakapag-aral, pwedeng mangarap. (Even the uneducated have the right to dream). Maraming may Ph.D na mas magaling magnakaw kaysa magsilbi. (There are Ph.D. graduates who are better at stealing than serving).

On personal issues
Do you regret having withdrawn your support from then President Joseph Estrada in 2001?
No, I donít regret having withdrawn support for President Joseph Estrada. When he was VP, I could see up close that he had the noblest of intentions. But somewhere along the way, a lot of things changed when he became president.

Fast Talk
Q: Why should one not vote for Senator Pacquiao?
A: Because I am running for President.

Q: Why should people vote for you?
A: Iíll be a bit arrogant: Iím the most qualified, Iím the most competent, Iím the most experienced.

Q: On Duterte and the ICC desire to investigate crimes against humanity, for the sake of the victims. Will you allow ICC?
A: The ICC is a court of the powerless. So you know my answer: Papayag ako."
Ping Lacson,Ping Lacson trusts Marcos to stand up vs. bullies,3/6/2025,https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/938367/ping-lacson-trusts-marcos-to-stand-up-vs-bullies/story/,"Former senator Panfilo ""Ping"" Lacson on Thursday expressed confidence that President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. would stand against ""bullies.""

Lacson's remarks came after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and United States President Donald Trump clashed in an exchange at the White House over Ukraine's war with Russia.

The senatorial candidate of the administration's Alyansa Para Sa Bagong Pilipinas said Philippine leaders and heroes have stood up to invaders and colonizers in the same way that Zelenskyy had ""refused to be cowed"" by Trump.

""I do hope and trust that our presidentónot just President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., but all other presidentsóhave stood up to foreign powers during the time of the Spaniards, Japanese and Americans. They all fought for our sovereignty and freedom,"" Lacson said in a radio interview.

""We have experienced this and I trust that regardless of who the bully is, our leaders will stand up for us,"" he added.

A Reuters report said Zelenskyy had seen the meeting in the Oval Office as an opportunity to convince the US not to side with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who ordered the invasion of Ukraine three years ago.

However, Trump and Vice President JD Vance leveled criticisms against Zelenskyy, saying the Ukrainian president showed disrespect, driving relations with Kyiv's most important wartime ally to a new low.

Zelenskyy was told to leave, a US official said.

Trump has since paused all U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

Marcos had repeatedly expressed support for Zelenskyy's ""search for peace,"" as he said the Philippines is ""watching with admiration, the bravery and nationalism that has been displaced by the Ukrainians"" amid Russia's attacks. ó VDV, GMA Integrated News"
Raul Lambino,Lambino to reveal source of false info on Duterte TRO,4/21/2025,https://globalnation.inquirer.net/273436/lambino-to-reveal-source-of-false-info-on-duterte-tro,"MANILA, Philippines ó Senatorial candidate Raul Lambino said on Monday that he would reveal the source of his information on what later turned out to be false, that the Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) on the arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte.

Lambino said he would disclose it once he had received the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) complaint.

READ: NBI files charges against Lambino, Cardema for spreading false info

ìI will put in my response the source of that information,î Lambino said in Filipino in a media forum in Quezon City.

When pressed as to where he got the information, Lambino said: ìIt is an information, well, it is an information that Iíve heard, as to if that information is true or not, I cannot give you a categorical answer.î

However, he later said: ìWe can assume that the information that reached us wasnít true after [it] came from the Supreme Court. But at that time, when the information came to us, we believed that it was true.î

In a Facebook live on March 11, Lambino claimed that the high court has issued a TRO halting Duterteís arrest and subsequent surrender to the International Criminal Court.

Article continues after this advertisement
However, the high court did not issue any TRO, prompting the NBI to accuse him of ìunlawful use of means of publication or unlawful utterances.î

Lambino said such a move is expected, adding that this is ìone of the factors to be consideredî when one is entering politics.

However, Lambino said he had not yet received the NBI complaint as he only found out about it on social media.

He also urged NBI operatives to send the complaint to his proper address.  He said authorities sent the documents to his old address in Manila, while his current address is in Mangaldan town in Pangasinan.

The high court also ordered Lambino to explain why he should not face administrative action over his claims."
Raul Lambino,SC orders lawyer to explain why he should not be charged for fake info,4/8/2025,https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1247725,"MANILA ñ The Supreme Court has directed lawyer Raul Lambino to show cause for spreading fake news about a supposed temporary restraining order (TRO) from the tribunal to stop the arrest of former president Rodrigo Duterte to face charges before the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands.

In a Tuesday press briefer, the SC said that during its April 2 session in Baguio City, the En Banc ordered Lambino to show cause within 10 days from notice why he should not face administrative action for spreading false information.

""In a Facebook Live broadcast on March 11, 2025, Attorney. Lambino falsely claimed that the Supreme Court had issued a TRO against the arrest of former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte. This misinformation caused public confusion and misled the people about the SCís actions,"" the court said.

The supposed TRO delayed the flight of the chartered jet ferrying Duterte for at least 12 hours.

Meanwhile, the SC on Tuesday ordered lawyer Christian Sia, who is running for a congressional seat, ìto show cause within a non-extendible period of 10 days from notice why no disciplinary action should be taken against himî for alleged sexist remarks against single mothers during a campaign stop.

A complaint was earlier filed by lawyers Allen Liberato-Espino and Michelle Laserna-Adricula against Sia over the incident.

This was followed by a letter from womenís rights group Gabriela asking the SC to investigate the same incident and impose the appropriate disciplinary action on Sia. (PNA)"
Raul Lambino,Lambino on 'fake news' allegation: I'm ready to face consequences,4/21/2025,https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/943392/lambino-on-fake-news-allegation-i-m-ready-to-face-consequences/story/,"Senatorial candidate Atty. Raul Lambino said Monday he is ready to face possible penalties should it be proven that he violated the law for supposedly spreading false information at the height of the arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte.

At a press conference, Lambino said he has yet to receive a copy of the complaint filed by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) with the Department of Justice (DOJ) against him for allegedly claiming that the Supreme Court (SC) issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) on the arrest of Duterte.

Likewise, he said that he has not yet received the show cause order issued by the SC against him regarding the same issue.

The lawyer said that he will formally answer the ìfake newsî allegation and reveal where he got the information regarding the alleged TRO once he receives a copy of the documents. Regardless, he stressed that he is prepared to face the consequences of his actions.

ìNormal ëyan sa aming mga [itís normal among us] lawyers that if you are being asked to show cause why you are not going to be meted [out] with corresponding penalty or what, kapag sa determination ng Supreme Court ay meron kang nilabag na order ng SC [if the SC sees that you violated an order] or violation of the ethics of lawyer, then you have to face the consequences,î Lambino said.

ìI am ready to face whatever penalty kung ëyan ang sasabihin ng Supreme Court sa akin [if that is what the SC tells me], then I am going to ... I am not going to defy the honorable Supreme Court for whatever order they may give me,î he added.

Prosecutor General Richard Anthony Fadullon, meanwhile, told GMA News Online that a subpoena may be issued against Lambino by the end of April.

ìThe case underwent evaluation so obviously, no subpoenas will be sent yet. Let us just wait for the [investigating prosecutor] to issue the subpoenas,î Fadullon said.

ìOnce assigned, issuance of the subpoena will follow. Hopefully before the end of the month,î he added.

To recall, on March 11, the day of Duterte's arrest, Lambino's camp and Senator Ronald ""Bato"" Dela Rosa filed a petition asking the SC to direct the government to release the former president from detention, and issue a TRO against the government's possible cooperation with the International Criminal Court (ICC).

Before the former president was flown to The Hague, Netherlands that night, social media posts claimed that the SC granted the request and issued a TRO.

The SC later on ordered Lambino to explain why he should not face administrative action for spreading false information. The lawyer, in response, said he had no intention to spread fake news.

Last Tuesday, the NBI also filed a complaint against Lambino and former National Youth Commission chairman Ronald Cardema over the same issue for supposed violation of Article 154 of the Revised Penal Code, or for unlawful use of means of publication and unlawful utterances.

Cardema, for his part, had denied that the information regarding the TRO came from him.

He said that the Duterte Youth Party-List will also launch a congressional inquiry on the alleged harassment or direction of the NBI, if it wins enough seats for the House of Representatives in Eleksyon 2025.

Duterte is currently detained at the Scheveningen Prison in The Hague, Netherlands for charges of crimes against humanity for the extrajudicial killings during his administration's war on drugs. ó RSJ, GMA Integrated News

Lito Lapid,LAPID ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY UNDER ADMINISTRATION TICKET,26-Sep-24,https://web.senate.gov.ph/press_release/2024/0926_lapid1.asp,"Senator Lito Lapid, now known by his fans as ""Supremo,"" formally announced his re-election bid in the 2025 midterm elections during the Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas Convention today, September 26, at the Philippine International Convention Center.

Lapid, who maintains his standing as one of the top 12 senatorial candidates in various surveys, is part of the administration coalition slate.

The Alyansa para sa Bagong Pilipinas is composed of five big political parties: Partido Federal ng Pilipinas of President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr; Nationalist People's Coalition of former Senate President Vicente Sotto III; Nacionalista Party of former Senate President Manny Villar; Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats of House Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez; and, National Unity Party of Rep. Luis Raymund Villafuerte.

The officers of the Alyansa signed a manifesto adhering to uphold and advance the vision and objectives of the administration of President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr., dedicated to fostering unity, economic stability, and social progress for the benefit of all Filipinos; to actively support, promote, and campaign for the senatorial candidates of the Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas, whose platforms align with the ideals of unity, development, and service to the nation; to fully endorse and advocate for the legislative agenda of the Marcos Administration, ensuring that its programs and policies for economic recovery, poverty reduction, and national security are successfully enacted and implemented; to work towards the greater cohesion of all sectors of society, encouraging dialogue, collaboration, and solidarity to achieve lasting peace, progress, and national harmony; and, to guarantee that the 12 May 2025 National and Local Elections will be conducted with the highest standards of honesty, orderliness, and transparency, ensuring that the democratic process is respected, and that the will of the people prevails.

""Unang-una po ay nagpapasalamat ako sa mahal na Pangulong Marcos at nasama tayo sa Bagong Pilipinas Coalition na isa ako sa 12 napili. Kaya maraming-maraming salamat po. Hangad ko po na maipagpatuloy ang mga nasimulan nating mga proyekto at mga programa para sa edukasyon, kalusugan, imprastraktura, trabaho, turismo at agrikultura. Mabuhay po kayo!"" Lapid said

Lapid, the son of a lavandera and stuntman, is a seasoned actor and a veteran politician has served the public without a trace of corruption for the past 30 years.

In his first six years as a senator during the 14th Congress, he placed 4th among his peers in the number of bills and resolutions filed. He fathered one of the meaningful social legislations of the 14th Congress, the Free Legal Assistance Act of 2010 which seeks to ensure that the poor would be afforded free quality legal service. He never wavered on making proposals that would uplift the living standards of the masses whose cause he has been championing.

As the chairperson of the Senate Committee on Games, Amusement, and Sports, he saw to it that measures are in motion to sufficiently ensure the development of sports in the grassroots, seeing to it that the youth develop a keen interest on participation to sports competition. In his first year at the helm of the Senate Committee on Tourism, he has initiated initiatives to oversee the development of the tourism potential of the country and gather the tools to ensure the country's success as it joins the tourism race with our Asian neighbors.

Another landmark piece of legislation principally authored by Lapid was Republic Act No. 11767, or the Foundling Recognition and Protection Act, which provided legal basis to register and support orphaned children and other foundlings in the Philippine territories. The Kapampangan senator also fathered Republic Act No. 11551, which integrates labor rights education in the tertiary education curriculum."

ìThe P30-million project aims to support the local indigenous community. The facility will serve as a venue for cultural preservation, heritage education, and community development,î Lapid said in an ambush interview on Tuesday, March 4.

He emphasized his dedication to the region, vowing to initiate more projects in Bicol that would truly benefit the people.

ìI vow to introduce more projects for Bicol that will genuinely benefit the people, particularly the indigenous communities, and ensure that their needs are met,î he added.

His visit to Albay province was part of his sortie, which included a motorcade from Tiwi, Malinao, Tabaco City, Bacacay, Malilipot, Sto. Domingo, Daraga and Legazpi City where he was warmly welcomed by supporters.

Before the motorcade, Lapid visited the Diocesan Shrine and Parish of Our Lady of Salvation in Joroan village in Tiwi.

Lapid also celebrated his inclusion in a recent survey, where he ranked among the top 12 candidates that voters are likely to select for the upcoming elections in May.

ìBeing included in the top 12 is proof that the people believe in my service. I will continue to serve the nation with dedication and ensure that their needs are addressed,î he said.

The senator also took the opportunity to thank the city government of Iriga for adopting him as an honorary son.

ìMy stepfather is from Iriga, and I am deeply honored by this recognition. I will continue to serve the people of Iriga and the entire Bicol region to the best of my abilities,î he added.

Lapid also assured residents that his future projects would further enhance the growth and welfare of local communities."
Lito Lapid,Lito Lapidís farm tour teaches us the power of humility and perseverance,14-Apr-24,https://www.abs-cbn.com/articles-news/lito-lapids-farm-tour-teaches-us-power-of-humility-and-perseverance-22087,"
As an action star, Lito Lapid seldom relies on stunt doubles, having been toughened by life's trials. Raised in poverty in Porac, Pampanga, as the son of a laundrywoman, he couldn't afford education. However, he learned perseverance early on from taking on odd jobs like harvesting palay to selling bread. Eventually, he transitioned into the film industry, starting as a bit player and stuntman.

His story is both unbelievable and inspiring considering his prominence now as a pillar of Philippine entertainment and a politician.

Despite his current wealth, the ìFPJís Batang Quiapoî star remains grounded. He isnít the type to boast about his brilliance, achievements, and riches. Even today, traces of his upbringing linger, particularly his connection to farming.

See a different side of ìLeon Guerreroî as he tours us around his ëhaciendaí and shares his success story on Bernadette Sembranoís latest vlog.

Entering the Lapid compound feels like stepping into a scene from a '70s action film, with elaborate gate designs, a grand mansion, rice fields, mango orchards, and a target shooting range within its grounds.

Bernadette remarked that itís unbelievable how Lito transformed from his impoverished beginnings, as that version of him contrasts his current stature. However, the seasoned actor maintains his humility, never forgetting his roots as ìanak ng labandera.î

He attributes his success to life's kindness, viewing it as mere coincidence. Yet, Bernadette believes it's not just luck but his mindset and perseverance that propelled him to where he is today. She learned that he preferred land as a talent fee over cash, a nod to his roots as a ìmagsasaka.î

Remaining loyal to his birthplace and hometown of Porac, Pampanga, Lito invested in properties in the province and stayed put. Despite the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, he managed to rebuild from the devastation.

Today, his compound features a thriving farm area, with him personally designing its irrigation system, ìDahil na-experience ko bilang magsasaka, kayang-kaya ko kung saan padadaanin ang tubig.î He is very much hands-on in managing his rice farm, applying the techniques, equipment, and rice varieties he learned in his youth. Harvesting rice is a bonding activity for him and his son Mark Lapid.

ìWala namang taong hindi nangangarap, eh. Kaya ëyung pangarap mo, kunin mo dahil sandali lang naman tayo dito sa buhay. Kahit lagi tayong kinakantyawan, maipapakita ko rin na ito naman ëyung nagawa ko,î he expressed when asked whether he truly dreamed of his current success.

It's almost as if his real-life story mirrors his on-screen roles as average guys facing ""villains"" who ridicule him for his humble beginnings and lack of diploma. However, rather than letting these insults deter him, they only fuel his grit and keep him firmly grounded.

ìTinatanggap ko na lang. Hindi naman ako nasasaktan. Wala naman akong magagawa doín, wala, eh, pinanganak tayong mahirap. Labandera lang ang nanay ko,î he said.

ìDahil hindi ako nakapag-aral, lagi akong inaapi pagdating sa edukasyon. Kaya ëpag ako nag-e-speech, lagi kong sinasabi sa kanila, pasalamatan mo ang iyong magulang dahil pinaaral kayo. Ako, gusto kong mag-aral pero hindi ako kinayang paaralin ng magulang ko. Dalawa kaming magkapatid. Namasukan ako para paaralin ko ang nakatatandang kapatid ko.î

Lito harbored ambitious dreams, but he never anticipated achieving all of them. As he often puts it, ""Sinwerte lang ako."" However, it's worth noting that he reached this status because he has the proper foundation and guidance.

As an actor, he drew inspiration from action legend Fernando Poe Jr., who had a distinct fighting style, so he crafted his own trademark technique, which features elaborate tricks such as tumbling and leaping before using his weapons like ropes, knives, and guns. He mentioned that his portrayal of the iconic character ìJulio Valienteî was inspired by the anime ìVoltes Vî which was very popular at the time, hence the one-bullet-two-kills gunslinger approach.

Meanwhile, his path as a politician took root when he led rescue operations and relief efforts in Pampanga alongside his showbiz peers. This compassion for the underprivileged flourished within him, shaping his main focus as a senator to assist those in need. Among the 800 bills he proposed, one he takes pride in is the Free Legal Assistance Act, which guarantees free, high-quality legal services for the less fortunate.

As they proceeded with the tour from the farm area to the swimming pool and target shooting range, Lito shared that he has no enemies in real life, even in politics. ìHindi naman ako nangangarap ng mas mataas na posisyon kaya hindi ako threat sa kanila.î

His story reminds us deeply that our lives are filled with potential for victory, but it takes humility to get there, ìWala ka namang ipagmamalaki, eh. Pansamantala lang naman ang lahat ng ito. Pansamantala lang akong senador. Pansamantala lang ako dito sa ibabaw ng mundo. Hiram lang lahat sa atin ng Panginoon.î

And his greatest legacy will be the inspiration he imparts through his rags-to-riches story, ìSana maging inspirasyon ako na kahit hindi nakapag-aral, isang stuntman, isang extra, anak ng labandera, naabot ko pa rin ito.î

ìHuwag silang matakot. Ako, puro takot ang inabot ko rito kasi parang wala akong tiwala sa sarili ko.î He added, ìHuwag níyong hayaan na sisikat ang araw at lulubog sa maghapon na wala kayong nalaman.î"
Lito Lapid,Lapid disappointed over bias against showbiz candidates,13-Mar-25,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2043588/lapid-disappointed-over-bias-against-showbiz-candidates,"TACLOBAN CITY ó Senator Lito Lapid has expressed frustrations over the continued bias against showbiz personalities like him who are seeking public office.

ìWhen actors like us enter politics, itís as if we are poisons. People donít want us here. But when professionals, lawyers, and wealthy individuals enter politics, itís like food for them (critics),î said Lapid in Filipino during a media conference Thursday in Palo town, Leyte.

Lapid is seeking another Senate term in the May 12 elections under the administration-backed Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas.

Several actors and entertainment figures are running in the May elections.

Aside from Lapid, other showbiz personalities vying for a seat in the Senate are reelectionist Senator Ramon ìBongî Revilla, former Senate President Tito Sotto, actor Philip Salvador, and comedian Willie Revillame.

Salvador and Revillame are running for the Senate for the first time.

Senators Robin Padilla and Jinggoy Estrada were also actors before entering politics.

Lapid admitted feeling hurt by the criticisms and how many people look down on actors who seek public office.

ìWe are not abnormal. We have feelings, too. We also get hurt,î he said.

Despite this, Lapid highlighted his legislative accomplishments, noting that since he became a senator in 2004, he has filed over 900 bills, about 100 of which have become laws.

Among the laws he authored are the Meat Labeling Act of 2011, the Comprehensive Unilateral Hearing Loss Research and Development and Rehabilitation Act, the Urban Agriculture and Vertical Farming Act, the Corporate Social Responsibility Act, the Kindergarten Education Act, the Adopt-A-Wildlife Species Act, and the Free Legal Assistance Act of 2010.

Lapid, who started his showbiz career in the 1970s as a stuntman, expressed gratitude to actor Coco Martin for casting him in his shows, admitting that his continued television exposure has helped younger audiences recognize him.

ìI thought the younger generationóthe millennialsóno longer knew me. But now they do. They call me ëSupremo,íî he said, referring to his character in the television series ìBatang Quiapo.î

Lapid acknowledged that his strong performance in election surveys could partly be attributed to his television appearances.

In the January survey conducted by Social Weather Stations, he ranked third to fourth among Senate candidates."

Lidasan faced ABS-CBNís Harapan 2025 on Friday. 

ìTalaga pong gusto nating ipakita ang liderato po ng kababaihan din. Pagrespeto sa kakayanan namin. Pero mas gusto nating ipakita yun pong pangangailangan na tumindig na ang mga kapatid nating Bangsamoro at saka mga katutubo kasi frustrated na po talaga kami sa ginagawang paikot-ikot na mga batas laban sa amin,î she said. 

ìYung ating mamamayan, yung taumbayan, yung mga kababayan ko po na nagsi-seek ng justice, nagsi-seek ng good governance, ito po yung kasama natin dito sa causa na ito na makapasok po sa Senado at madala po ang kanilang mga hinaing, pakikibaka at boses,î she added.  

If elected, Lidasanís first bill will push for the recognition of the rights of the said marginalized sectors.

ìYung pagtatayo po ng mga eskwelahan, yung pagrespeto sa mga lumad schools na ipinasara po ng DepDed kasi kailangan po talaga yan. At syempre po doon sa Human Rights Defenders Act din po na hindi po mapush sa loob ng Kongreso,î she explained.  

Lidasanís views have been largely shaped by the violence she personally saw in Matanog, Maguindanao growing up. 

She said her father was illegally arrested during Martial Law and their community bombed since the 70s. 

ìIn every administration meron silang sariling all out war sa community namin. May laging imprint ng paano nila dinahas o isinawalang bahala ang peace negotiation para ipakita yung military might nila,î Lidasan said. 

ìYung foreign policy natin yung pagsunod na kahit may peace talks dito sa ating bansa ay nala-lump together ang lahat ng mga armed groups like ang MNLF at ang MILF as terrorist groups. Ngayon pati ang New Peopleís Army kaya na-u-undermine talaga ang any peace efforts na ginagawa sa ating bansa.î 

This drives Lidasan more to fight for their rights through scrutinizing laws. 

ìWe have to study the law, the laws passed concerning us and then we have to get the reactions from the communities na apektado ng mga batas na ito. Ano ba ang pagtinign nila,î she stated.

Lidasan appealed for support for her candidacy to give the Moros and IPs a voice in the Senate and for them to receive the justice and service which have long been overdue. 

ìAng mga kapatid ko pong Moro at mga katutubo ay kailangan po ng matindi, malakas na boses para ipaglaban ang kanilang mga karapatan. Pero bukod po doon, nararapat din po na mabigyan na din sila ng hustisya kasi for how many decades lagi na lang pong nasa laylayan ang mga kapatid ninyo. Ang mga issues namin ay dinidismiss at saka parang hindi na tinitignan as a national issue,î she said.  

ëIsa pong matinding kailangan nating i-put sa forefront po ngayon ay ang rights, karapatan po ng mga kapatid nating Moro at katutubo sa lupang ninuno, sa kanilang karapatan sa sariling pagpasya. Yun pong pagpapauland ng aming kultura the way na gusto namin idevelop siya para sa aming komunidad at saka po yung tunay na kapayanapaan na nakabase sa hustisya.î

ìWhatís happening in Mindoro reminds me of the situation in Mindanaoóour communities are being bombed, displaced, and silenced,î Lidasan said, citing alleged killings and abduction of some Mangyan community members who were labeled as communist rebels.†

ìThis is not just a campaign stopóitís a commitment. As a Moro and Indigenous candidate, I must reach out to marginalized communities. I am here to listen, to stand with the people, and to bring their voices to the halls of power,î she added.†

ìCongress must look into the aerial strafing and assess the long-term impact of the oil spill in the province. We call on fellow political candidates to take a stand and show support for the residents of Mindoro,î she said.†

Amirah Lidasan,Edsa revolt still relevant as same conditions persist ñ Makabayan bet,25-Feb-25,https://www.inquirer.net/430277/edsa-revolt-still-relevant-as-same-conditions-persist-makabayan-bet/,"MANILA, Philippines ó The spirit of the Edsa People Power Revolution remains relevant today, as the same issues that led to the 1986 uprising continue to persist, Makabayan senatorial candidate Amirah ìMekî Lidasan said on Tuesday.

ìMaraming nagsasabi sa atin, bakit ba tayo gumugunita ng Edsa? Hindi naman tayo partisipante ng Edsa. Kasi hanggaít sa ngayon, nagpapatuloy ang mga kondisyon kung bakit naghimagsik ang mga mamamayan noong 1986,î Lidasan said during a protest commemorating the revolutionís 39th anniversary at the University of the Philippines Diliman.

(Many ask us, why do we commemorate Edsa? We werenít participants of Edsa. Itís because, even now, the conditions that drove people to revolt in 1986 still persist.)

Lidasan cited corruption, political dynasties, and the political rivalry between the Duterte and Marcos families as among the continuing issues.

ìNandyan din ang korapsyon sa loob ng ating pamahalaan. Kaliwaít kanan ang korapsyon. Nag-aaway marahil ang Marcos at Duterte, pero ang mga dinastiya nila, ang mga political dynasties ay nananaig pa rin. Ang pinag-aawayan lang nila ay ang kanilang interes,î she said.

(Corruption remains rampant in our government. Corruption is everywhereóperhaps the Marcoses and Dutertes are fighting, but their political dynasties still prevail. They are only fighting for their interests.)

The Makabayan candidate also highlighted the ongoing struggles in rural areas, particularly for Moro and indigenous communities.

ìNandyan din ang mga kondisyon ng pag-aklas ng mga mamamayan sa kanayunan. Ang mga kapatid ninyong Moro at katutubo na magpasa-hanggang sa ngayon, hindi lang pinagkakaitan ng mga batayang serbisyo tulad ng edukasyon, ngunit pinapatay pa, pinombomba at ginagawang lunsaran ng giyera ang aming komunidad,î she added.

(The conditions for uprisings in rural areas remain. Our Moro and indigenous brothers and sisters continue to be deprived of basic services like education, and worse, they are killed, bombed, and their communities turned into battlegrounds.)

With this, Lidasan stressed that the Edsa commemoration serves as a call for change in the country.

ìAt kami, ang mga kapatid ninyo Moro at katutubo, ay napilitan na sagutin ang hamon ng taong bayan na tayo ay mag-provide ng alternatibo para sa eleksyon na ito. Isang alternatibo na magbibigay ng plataporma ng kagyat na kaginhawaan sa mga kababayan natin, karapatan at kasarinlan at pambansang demokrasya,î she said.

(We, your Moro and indigenous brothers and sisters, have accepted the peopleís challenge to provide an alternative in this electionóan alternative that offers immediate relief to our people, promotes rights and independence, and upholds national democracy.)

She added that their electoral platform aims to present a genuine solution to the countryís issues.

ìNilalagay natin ang programa ng pambansang demokrasya sa eleksyon na ito bilang alternatibo sa kasamaan, mga kriminal at kadiliman. Ibibigay natin ang tunay na solusyon sa problema ng bayan para magising ang mamamayan,î Lidasan said.

(We are putting forward the program of national democracy in this election as an alternative to evil, criminals, and darkness. We will offer real solutions to the countryís problems to awaken the people.)

Lidasan underscored the importance of commemorating the Edsa uprising not just as a historical observance but as a renewed commitment to continue the struggle for justice.

ìKaya natin ginagawa ang paggunita na ito ng Edsa, hindi dahil sa naggugunita lang tayo kung hindi, testamento ito, panata natin ito sa patuloy nating pakikibaka at sa pagsabing makatarungan ang paghihimagsik at maghimagsik tayo para sa ating kinabukasan,î she said."

Rodante Marcoleta on Tuesday grilled Commodore Jay Tarriela, a Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) spokesperson, for calling him out when he said ìthere is no such thing as the West Philippine Sea.î

During the resumption of the House tri-committee hearing, Marcoleta could not help but bring up the statement of the PCG spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea reportedly calling  him a ìtraitor.î

ìNow, there was a commodore who called me a traitor without looking into the context of what I was talking about. Why not tell them that we have been trying to register the West Philippine Sea, but we could not register it so it is not recognized?î Marcoleta said in Fiilipino.

Marcoleta explained that he only meant the West Philippine Sea was not visible on maps.

ìSince itís not yet registered, countries in Europe would need to search this on YouTube first before they can see the West Philippine Seaís location since anyone who would Google that particular area of our world can only read the South China Sea label,î he said.

ìBut it doesnít mean that the South China Sea is solely owned by China ó in the same manner that the Indian Ocean is not solely owned by India,î he added.

In response, Tarriela clarified that he did not call Marcoleta a traitor and was only referring to President Ferdinand Marcosís statement.

Reading his statement, Tarriela said that he only stood by the statement of Marcos who said in Filipino:  ìThe West Philippine Sea is not a figment of our imagination. It is ours. It will continue to be ours as long as our spirit continues to burn for our beloved country.î

ìHearing someone claim that the ëWest Philippine Seaí is merely a fabrication of the Philippine government is a disservice and an embarrassment to their entire party, the organization they belong to, and even their own family,î Tarrielaís statement posted on X (formerly Twitter) last February 4 read.

ìHow can one face the younger generations today and tell them that our Exclusive Economic Zone to the west of our archipelago is nonexistent, effectively giving up the fight to assert their rights as Filipinos in the West Philippine Sea?î he added.

Still irked by the bashing he received, Marcoleta asked Tarriela why he had not issued a statement clarifying that the ìtraitorî remark did not come from him.

ìI am not under any obligation to tell all social media influencers [or] bloggers to defend your name, to tell them that you are not a traitor. Those words did not come from me. Why would I go to the extent of defending you when you are running for Senate?î the PCG official answered.

ìI might as well be interpreted as running for or supporting somebody for public office,î he further asserted.

Claim: A West Philippine Sea label was added to Google Maps because Sagip Representative Rodante Marcoleta spoke up about the issue.

Rating: FALSE
Why we fact-checked this: The Facebook post bearing the false claim has garnered 1,200 reactions, 639 shares, and 198 comments as of writing.

A screenshot of Google Maps with the West Philippine Sea label present and a photo of Marcoleta with the Philippine flag are included in the post. ìDahil sayo nasa Google Map (sic) na ang West Philippine Sea (Because of you, the West Philippine Sea is on Google Maps),î text on the photo says.

The caption addresses the post to Marcoletaís critics and those who say he is pro-China. It also says that ìKa Danteî spoke up about the issue of the West Philippine Sea and fought for the label to be added on the maps so that Filipinos can be given the right information. 

Another Facebook post has the caption ìDahil kay Marcoleta, opisyal ngang naka-label sa Google Map ang ëWest Philippine Seaí sa mapa ng Pilipinas!î 

(Because of Marcoleta, Google Maps has officially labeled the ëWest Philippine Seaí on the map of the Philippines!)

The facts: In an April 15 statement sent to Rappler, Google said that the West Philippine Sea has always been labeled on Google Maps, but recent changes were made to the labelís visibility to make it easier to see at additional zoom levels.

Meanwhile, Marcoleta drew flak for his statements during a February 4 House hearing where he said, ìKahit na basahin mo yung ating mapa (Even if you read our map) or what, there is no West Philippine Sea.î

After other government officials, experts, and fact-checking organizations called out the legislator for his false claim, Marcoleta clarified his stance in the succeeding House hearing on February 18. He noted that his statement was based on the lack of the ìWest Philippine Seaî label on world maps.

ìThat [statement] was in context of the fact that it is not yet registered in the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO),î he added. 

The West Philippine Sea, which refers to the maritime areas along the western side of the Philippine archipelago that are within the countryís 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone, is codified in the governmentís official documents.

Marcoletaís election bid: Because of his previous statements, Marcoleta said in the same February 18 House hearing that people have been bashing him and calling him pro-China. 

Marcoleta is running for senator in the May 2025 national elections. The Social Weather Stationsí April pre-election survey saw the lawmaker fall from the winning circle to 19th to 20th place.

Rodante Marcoleta has been removed from five panels in the House of Representatives, including the powerful Commission on Appointments (CA).

During Wednesday's House plenary session, House Deputy Majority Leader and Iloilo City Rep. Jam Baronda moved to replace Marcoleta from the CA and the committees on energy, justice, public accounts, and constitutional amendments.

The lower chamber elected Manila Teachers party-list Rep. Virgilio Lacson to replace Marcoleta.

ìMr. Speaker, on the part of the majority, I move to nominate and elect to the Commission on Appointments, to the Committee on Energy, to the Committee on Justice, to the Committee on Public Accounts and (the Committee on) Consti Amendments Representative Virgilio Lacson vice Rep.

ìIs there any objection? The chair hears none, the motion is approved,î Presiding Officer, House Deputy Speaker and Cebu 5th District Representative Duke Frasco said.

There was no mention of the reason for changes in the committee membership during the session. Only members of the committee can make motions and vote during panel hearings.


'THE PRICE I HAVE TO PAY'

ìThis is the price I have to pay for adhering to established rules, regulations, as well as the standards of parliamentary practice,î Marcoleta, an ally of the Duterte family, said in a message.

ìI may have been bloodied, but will remain unbowed fighting for what is just and right,î he added. 

During the House Committee on Appropriationsí deliberations on the proposed 2025 budget of the Office of the Vice President, Marcoleta called out lawmakers for not giving courtesy to the OVP. 

He also raised questions on the inquiry conducted by the House Committee on Good Government and Public Accountability into the OVPís alleged misuse of confidential funds, which was seen by at least one lawmaker as ìrebukingî the panel. 

Marcoleta remains a member of four House committees, namely, Basic Education and Culture, Government Enterprises and Privatization, Housing and Urban Development, and Transportation.

Rodante Marcoleta said on Wednesday about the deaths during former President Rodrigo Duterteís drug war.

ìThereís collateral damage. Thatís how it is. These people will fight. Theyíre criminals. Will we allow that? Our laws may have imperfections, but there are no perfect systems in this world,î Marcoleta said in Filipino during a press conference on Wednesday at the University of the Philippines in Diliman, Quezon City.

Marcoleta held the press conference with former Sen. Gringo Honasan, a fellow senatorial candidate, to announce a petition to be submitted to the International Criminal Court (ICC) regarding Duterte.

For his part, Honasan said in a mix of English and Filipino: ìLetís play fair. We counted the victims of tokhang, right? But did we count the victims of drug pushers?î

ìWe will make mistakes [on] both sides. No administration has a perfect record. But, to elevate it to crimes against humanity?î he added.

ìTokhangî is a combination of two Cebuano words ó ìtoktokî or ìto knockî and ìhangyoî to ìto plead with.î That was supposed to the tactic of law enforcers during the drug war ó knock on doors of suspected drug pushers and plead with them to stop their trade.

According to government data, there were around 6,000 deaths due to Duterteís drug war.

However, human rights watchdogs place the death toll between 12,000 and 30,000.

Citing deaths during the anti-drug campaign, the ICC prosecutor alleges that Duterte committed crimes against humanity.

The former president was arrested on March 11 and brought to The Hague, Netherlands, to face the international tribunal.

The petition announced by Honasan and Marcoleta seeks to request a leave for Duterte from the ICC to address the validity of his arrest and the ìurgent needî to release and return him to the Philippines.

ìLet us not allow a court whose policies we do not understand to be the first to make a judgment. We have our own prevailing laws. This is what we want to happen. Thatís why weíre filing this petition,î Marcoleta said."

Speaking on Saturday, Senator Marcos admitted to the cold ties between them but did not elaborate on the cause of their distance. This revelation has sparked public interest, especially given the political influence both siblings wield in the country.

The Marcos familyís political legacy has been a central force in Philippine politics, and any perceived rift between its key figures inevitably draws attention. While some speculate that differences in political strategy or governance could be factors, no official explanation has been provided.

Observers are now questioning how this tension might affect their political alignment and future interactions. With upcoming elections and ongoing governance challenges, any division within the Marcos family could have implications for their political standing and influence.

Despite the revelation, neither President Marcos nor Senator Marcos has made further statements clarifying the nature of their strained relationship. As discussions around this issue continue, the public remains eager to see whether the siblings will reconcile or if their distance will persist in the political arena.

","MANILA ó Sen. Imee Marcos on Thursday admitted she has had no communication with her brother, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., while MalacaÒang denied an alleged rift between the siblings.

The lawmaker said she has not talked to her brother even before she led a Senate investigation on his government's arrest and surrender of former President Rodrigo Duterte to stand trial before the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity in the drug war.

ìMatagal na kami hindi masyado nag-uusap. Maraming humaharang. Matagal na,"" the senator said in a press conference.

""Nakikita ko lang ëpag public events. At saka, mabilis lang yun, maraming tao,"" she added.

Asked whether she felt the Senate probe on Duterteís arrest had angered the President, Sen. Marcos said yes.  

""Nung umpisa, sabi nila, hindi na daw makikilahok yung gobyerno. Pakatapos nun, ang dami-dami ng testigo, ah, sabi ko, okay na. Ang dami-dami, nagpapadagdag pa nga sila ng pangalan, nagpadagdag pa nga sila ng upuan, kinapos pa nga tayo ng pagkain,î the senator said.

ìNagulat naman ako nung nagalit na nga, kasi nga siguro hindi nagkakasundo yung mga sagot, hindi tumutugma.  Hindi ko na kasalanan yun. Malay ko ba kung anong isasagot nila.î

Sen. Marcos said she was keeping the doors open for a reconciliation with her brother. But she also claimed some people were driving a wedge between them.

""Lagi naman akong nandito, lagi naman akong manang. Hindi mo ako nagbabago kailanman. At mula pa nung bata kami, parati naman siyang pinagbibilin ng tatay ko na alalayan. Ang problema, hindi ko na magampanan. At maraming humaharang, hindi nakikinig, hindi ko alam,î she said.

LEAVING ALYANSA 
Sen. Marcos has been skipping the campaign rallies of her brother's Senate slate, the Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas. The President has mentioned his sister among his candidates in his last speeches.

Sen. Marcos said leaving the ticket was for the best.

""Palagay ko, sila rin nahihirapan. Pag hindi ako sisipot, tapos na-announce na nila na 11 lang,  tapos hindi na binabanggit yung pangalan ko, para huwag nang nag-aalanganin. Mas klaro, di ba?î she said.

""Yeah, okay lang, okay lang. Walang problema kasi nga sabi ko, nakatutok naman ako dito. Hindi naman na eleksyon, kampanya, politika ang pinaka-importante. Nangingibabaw sa akin itong mga dagok sa ating kalayaan, sa ating soberanya. Hindi ko kaya to eh. Talagang ipaglalaban ko yan. ""

""Yung hindi binanggit, pagkatapos sabi, labing isa na lamang ang kanilang kandidato, eh huwag na tayo magpahirapan ng katawan, eh sabi ko, kakalas na muna ako kung nahihirapan kayo. Mas madali naman ganun, okay lang sa akin, walang problema.""

Malacanang agreed that Sen. Marcosí exit from Alyansa would be for the best, especially if she felt that her values were not aligned with the administration coalition.

ìSa ngayon po, siya naman po ang nagsabi na siyaíy kumakalas na sa Alyansa dahil ang sabi niya ay hindi yata pareho ang kanilang mga adhikain, ang adbokasiya,î Malacanang Press Officer Claire Castro said.

ìKung hindi po talaga nalilinya ang kaniyang mga paniniwala sa paniniwala ng Alyansa, mas maganda po siguro talaga na siya ay umalis dahil kung hindi niya po paniniwalaan ang mga programa ng Alyansa, hindi po talaga magkakaroon ng magandang relationship,î she said in a Palace press briefing.

Castro declined to speculate on the relationship between the President and his older sister when asked whether Duterteís arrest had caused a rift between the siblings.

ìAs we can see from the statements of Senator Imee Marcos, it seems like there is. But on the part of the President, we cannot say that thereís a rift between the relationship Ö in the relationship of the two siblings. So, hintayin na lang po natin kung mayroon mang sasabihin ang Pangulo,î she said.

ìBut sa ugali kasi ng Pangulo, hindi po siya masyadongÖalam ninyo po iyon, hindi siya pikon. Kaya kahit anong banat, kahit nakita na ninyo po si Senator Imee Marcos na nandudoon sa Maisug rally habang binabanggit ng dating Pangulong Duterte ang paninira sa kaniya, kay PBBM, wala po tayong nadinig. Wala rin po tayong nadinig na anumang hinanakit, kung mayroon man ha, mula sa Pangulo para sa kaniyang kapatid.î

Sen. Marcos declined to comment on Castroís remarks.

""In the immortal word of my mother, Imelda Romualdez Marcos, to patol is human, to deadma is divine. Let's be divine,"" she said.

Regarding the Senate panel probe on the arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte, the senator denied doing the investigation to help her candidacy.

""Hindi naman ako nag-imbestiga para magpasikat or ma-endorso or maging bahagi ng ibang partido. Nag-imbestiga ako para malaman kung ano talaga ang nangyari at kung talagang nasunod ang batas ng Pilipinas, kung talagang kaya natin tayuan ang ating soberanya at Kalayaan,"" she said.

Marcos pointed out that the arrest ofDuterte has implications beyond the political dynastic feud between the 2 families.

""Palagay ko, lampas-lampas na to sa Duterte at Marcos. Ang pinag-uusapan na dito, yung soberanya ng ating bansa. Mabigat na to eh. Ibang usapan na ito. Kung ano-ano nang dagok ang nangyayari. Ito nga, yung mga EDCA sites, yung mga typhon missiles, yung sangkatutak na banggaan, kuno dyan sa West Philippine Sea. Ano lang matitira sa atin? Pati yung mamamayang dinadampot na lamang at naging probinsya na tayo ng The Hague,"" she said.

VILLAR
Marcos, meanwhile, said she had no information on the status of her partymate in the Nacionalista Party, Camille Villar who is also an administration senatorial candidate but who has missed campaign allies since the arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte. Members of the Villar family have come out in support of the former leader.

""Wala, wala. Actually, I saw her dad yesterday. Wala naman binanggit. Tinatanong ko, may direktiba ba ang NP? Sabi nila, wala. Yung NP kasi, chill na chill kasi na kwan yun eh. Na Partido. Hindi masyadong nakikialam. So, hindi pa kami naguusap ni Camille. Pero ang sabi naman, ang sabi  sa diario sumipot daw si Camille doon sa meeting noong 24 ba yun? Oo, diba?

Asked during an ambush interview in Tondo, Manila, if she was concerned about being misled by another Marcos this election season, Duterte drew a clear distinction between the two siblings.

ìMagkaiba si Senator Imee Marcos at si BBM,î Duterte said. ìTulad na lang rin ng example koóna hindi parehong tao at magkaiba din kami ni [dating] Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte at iba din si Inday Sara.î

(She doesn't neglect her responsibilities or the nation's problems. She keeps her promises, provides solutions, and thinks things through.)

Duterte's endorsement of Imee Marcos came just weeks after she withdrew from President Marcos' senatorial slate.

Senator Marcos had earlier distanced herself from the administration, citing differences in values and principlesóparticularly in the arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte, Saraís father.

The elder Duterte is currently detained at Scheveningen Prison in The Hague, Netherlands, facing charges of crimes against humanity over the extrajudicial killings linked to his administrationís war on drugs. ó DVM, GMA Integrated News

Norman Marquez,Norman Marquez wants to take animal welfare advocacy to the Senate,28-Feb-25,https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/937665/norman-marquez-wants-to-take-animal-welfare-advocacy-to-the-senate/story/,"Independent senatorial candidate Norman Marquez wants to take his advocacy for animal welfare to the Senate, believing legislation is needed to institutionalize the support and care for animals.

In a radio interview, Marquez discussed his proposed programs for free animal welfare services should he land a Senate seat.

He said the majority of the Filipino population are pet owners, but government programs for animal welfare are wanting.

ìAng rabies ay lalong lumalala nang lumalalaÖ Kahit na po mayroong programa ang local government nits (LGUs) na tutulong pa din sa kanila, karaniwan sa programa kasi na napapansin natin ay hindi talaga para sa mga mahihirap o mga marginalized na pet owners 'no. Kasi, ang ginagawa nila na pamamaraan ay shortcut 'no? Mapangmadalian at pinapatay 'yong mga inosente na hayop imbes na matulungan,î he said.

(Rabies cases are getting worseÖ Even if LGUs have programs to help them, usually these programs are not really geared towards the poor or marginalized pet owners. Theyíre doing shortcuts. Theyíre rushing it and killing innocent animals instead of helping them.)

Marquez said he intends to enlist the help of civic organizations and the business sector to help the government implement animal welfare programs.

ìAng makikinabang din naman [sa program] ay human, right? Kasi animal welfare is human welfare. Kung malusog ang mga hayop mo sa loob ng bahay or sa bakuran, pati mga pamilya ay malusog din. Hindi mahahawa sa diseases at ang ating pangkabuhayan, 'yong mga livelihood na mga mambababoy at mga magmamanok, at ang mga may baka ay maaayos. Matutugunan din 'yong mga health para 'yong livelihood nila ay hindi mapinsala 'no?î he shared.

(The people who will benefit [from the program] are humans, right? Because animal welfare is human welfare. If the animals inside your home or backyard are healthy, your family will be healthy as well. They wonít catch diseases. We can run our livelihood like piggeries and poultry well.)

ìAng point natin dito is magkakaroon tayo ng mga libreng mga kapon, bakuna kasi kulang ang budget. Magkakaroon tayo ng budget diyan,î he added.

(Our point is to have free spaying, vaccines because thereís not enough budget. We will be having a budget for that.)

He said he has heard some views seemingly questioning his capacity to win because animals can't vote, anyway.

""Ang mali po nila ngayon, hindi nila na-realize ang sinasabi ko sa kanila na 94% ng botante ay pet owner,î he said.

(Their mistake is that they donít realize that 94% of voters are pet owners.)

Meanwhile, independent senatorial aspirant, Atty. Angelo de Alban, conducted campaign activities in Cebu.

Another independent, vlogger Marc Gamboa, visited barangays in Valenzuela, while Aksyon Demokratikoís Wilbert Lee joined 88 Agri party-list in meeting farmers and residents in Iriga, Camarines Sur.

Eric Martinez,Political butterfly? Martinez says he was replaced as official bet,2-Feb-25,https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/934878/political-butterfly-martinez-says-he-was-replaced-as-official-bet/story/,"Valenzuela Representative Eric Martinez on Saturday contradicted allegations that he was a ìpolitical butterfly,î one who switches from one political party to another, saying that he did not leave his party but was replaced.

During the face-off round of ìTanong ng Bayan: The GMA Senatorial Face-Off 2025,î Martinez said that LAKAS-CMD chose another person as its official local candidate in the 2010 elections.

ìLocal politics came into play. Pinalitan kami, ibang partido ang kinuha nila bilang official nilang kandidato locally. Wala kaming magawa, lumipat ako sa Liberal,î Martinez said.

(Local politics came into play. We were replaced and they chose another to be their official local candidate. Our hands were tied then so I switched to the Liberal Party.)

According to GMA News Research, Martinez ran as councilor under LAKAS-CMD in 2004 and as vice mayor in 2007.

He then ran for another term as vice mayor under the Liberal Party in 2010 and was a member of the political party until 2015.

In 2016, Martinez joined the PDP Laban and ran as a House representative.

ìPagdating ng 2015, hindi ako umalis. Pinalitan uli ako. Local politics came into play. May kandidatong congressman, ëyun ang mas pinili nila siguro dahil ako ay vice mayor nung panahon na yun,î Martinez said.

(In 2025, I did not leave. I was replaced. Local politics came into play. There was a candidate for congressman. That's probably what they chose because I was Vice Mayor at the time.)

ìTumatakbo akong independent ngayon. Tumakbo tayo under the banner of unity,î he added.

Eric Martinez,Registrar clarifies: Martinez studied in UST but did not graduate,12-Apr-25,"https://varsitarian.net/news/20250412/registrar-clarifies-martinez-studied-in-ust-but-did-not-graduate
","The tarpaulins, posted near Gates 10 and 11 on Dapitan Street, stated at the bottom, ìBATCH ë93 BCS-BA,î suggesting that Martinez completed his bachelor of science in commerce, major in business administration, in 1993.

After a check of University records, however, Assistant Registrar Kashmer Cruz told the Varsitarian that Martinez was enrolled in UST until 1995 but was unable to complete his studies.

ìBased on the records of the Office of the Registrar, Eric Morales Martinez was enrolled in the University of Santo Tomas under the program Bachelor of Science in Commerce Business Administration from 1st sem [of] 1989-1990 to 2nd sem, 1994-1995,î Cruz said.

ìHowever, the program was not completed; hence, there is no graduation date,î she added.

Martinezís profile on the website of Partido ng Demokratiko Pilipino Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban), the pro-Duterte political party under which he is running, also contradicts UST records.

Martinezís short biography indicated that he served as the public relations officer of the Junior Chamber of Business Administration of UST from 1993 to 1997, or until two years after he supposedly left the University based on University records.

The congressmanís profile on Valenzuelaís official website also states that he took up business administration at UST and was an officer of the programís organization until 1997.

As of this writing, the two tarpaulins have been removed.

UST Secretary General Fr. Louie Coronel, O.P. earlier said UST had consulted its legal counsel and would ìkeep in touch with Mr. Eric Martinez to cease and desist from using the Universityís name and logo in any campaign-related materials.î

Coronel had also emphasized that the use of USTís name and any version of its logo ó whether old or new ó in materials that imply the schoolís endorsement is prohibited.

The Varsitarian has reached out to Martinezís camp but has yet to receive a response as of posting time."

Atty. Sonny Matula,#BakitIkaw: Atty. Sonny Matula commits to advocating for Filipino workers if elected to Senate,21-Feb-25,https://dzrh.com.ph/post/bakitikaw-atty-sonny-matula,"Labor leader and senatorial candidate Atty. Sonny Matula has pledged to continue championing the rights of Filipino workers if he secures a seat in the Senate in the upcoming midterm elections.

""Ang ating pagtakbo ay nakahanda tayo, ibig sabihin ay hindi tayo ikahihiya ng mga mangagawa na irepresenta sila sa Senado,"" Matula said during the Bakit Ikaw: The DZRH Job Interview on Friday.

The current President of the Federation of Free Workers firmly believes that the Senate should not be treated like a private corporation where only relatives, siblings, or even celebrities are elected. He emphasized that one is enough to represent the people.

""Bakit ikaw?""

Matula emphasized that he advocates for livable wages for all Filipino workers, highlighting his active involvement in initiatives to raise salaries, not just in Metro Manila, but across the entire Philippines.

""Kaya sinusuportahan natin ëyung naaprubahan na House Bill. Second reading na at third reading na lang ang kulang at P200. Pero sabi nga natin ëyung P200 ay significant na pero dapat dumating tayo doon sa living wage na sinasabi,"" said Matula.

""Kung hindi natin iyan makukuha sa legislation, gagawin natin iyan sa pamamagitan pag-organisa ng union at sa pakipag collective bargaining negotiation sa mga employers,"" he added.

Moreover, he also advocates for focusing on job security, firmly stating that workers in permanent positions should remain permanent and should not be subjected to contractual employment.

He emphasized that there should be no contractualization in regular jobs, stressing that practices like ""555"" and ""ENDO"" should be ended, as they reflect the idea that workers are disposable.

Matula also advocates for the respect of human rights and the rights of workers, particularly those in unions.

""Pang-apat syempre imoderno natin ang agrikultura patungo sa agri-industrialization na makalihkha ng maraming trabaho,"" Matula stated.

""At panlima, tutukan rin ang scholarship para sa mga anak ng manggagawa at anak ng mga magsasaka,"" he added.

He asserts that education is the essential tool for Filipinos to rise above poverty and build a better future.

Efforts to end ""ENDO"" during Duterte administration

Matula expressed his dissatisfaction with the unmet promise of former President Rodrigo Duterte to end contractualization in the country during his administration.

When asked to rate Duterte's efforts in fulfilling his promise, Matula gave him a score of zero.

""Syempre kung pag-usapan ay ang paghinto ng ENDO, zero kasi walang nangyari,"" said Matula.

""Natakot siya sa mga employer. SinabIhan siya na 'kapag tinuloy mo ëyan, magsasara ang mga kumpanya.' Paano magsasara regular nga ëyung mga trabaho na ginagawa ng manggagawa pero ëyung manggagawa five months o contractual,"" he added.

He emphasized that workers in regular jobs should not be contractual, but this is still happening in factories across Calabarzon, Metro Manila, Central Luzon, and other regions.

Matula then urged that Article 106 of the Labor Code of the Philippines, which covers Contracting and Subcontracting, should be reviewed, emphasizing that labor-only contracting should be clearly deemed prohibited.

Wage hike

The senatorial candidate expressed his belief that a P200 wage increase is feasible, particularly given the current rise in prices of goods, transportation fares, and the ongoing food security concerns.

""Kapag may pera ang manggagawa, umiikot iyan sa ekonomiya,"" he firmly stated.

In addressing concerns that Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) may face difficulties in complying with the wage hike, Matula highlighted that there are existing laws that could provide assistance to these businesses.

Matula cited the Barangay Micro Business Enterprises (BMBE) law as an example, noting that businesses with a registered capital of up to P3 million are exempt from the minimum wage requirements.

He further mentioned that even large companies, if unable to comply, can file a petition for an exemption for a certain period.

""Hinihikayat din natin ang gobyerno na bigyan ng programa na makakatulong sa maliliit na negosyo,"" he added.

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace

He noted that regarding the use of AI in the workplace, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), TESDA, as well as the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the Department of Finance, should engage in discussions on the matter.

Furthermore, he mentioned that he sees the ""Trabaho Para sa Bayan"" council as the vehicle to study the future of work and how to address this significant challenge.

Matula emphasized that it should be an all-government and all-society approach.

Providing assistance and support for single parents

Matula emphasizes the need for affirmative action to support single parents, suggesting that the work-from-home law could provide a valuable option for those who are primarily at home.

Additionally, he emphasized the important role of the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) in assisting single parents through the enhancement of their skills and knowledge.

""Ayuda""

Matula believes that the Senate should use its oversight function to 'review the movements of the executive department'.

Citing the Tulong Panghanapbuhay sa Ating Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers (TUPAD), he emphasized the need to review such assistance programs in collaboration with trade unions and employer associations.

""Dapat ëyung mga trade unions at employers association ay dapat kasama sa oversight na gagawin para makita kung tunay bang pumupunta itong mga ayuda ng gobyerno sa mga tao talagang nangangailangan,"" he added.

He emphasized that the oversight audit should verify whether the aid is being properly distributed or if it is being exploited by politicians for improper use.

Impeachment complaint against Vice President Sara Duterte

Matula acknowledged that it is inevitable for the impeachment case against the Vice President to become an election issue, as it is a crucial matter concerning the accountability of public officials.

He further noted that the positive outcome of this issue would be raising awareness among candidates, especially those running for the highest offices, about their responsibility to ensure the accountability of high-ranking officials in the Philippines.

If elected, Matula said he will play a significant role as a Senator in the upcoming impeachment trial against the country's second-highest official."

Atty. Sonny Matula,"Labor lawyer, workersí group ask Supreme Court to disqualify Quiboloy",16-Jan-25,https://www.inquirer.net/425485/labor-lawyer-workers-group-ask-supreme-court-to-disqualify-quiboloy/,"MANILA, Philippines ó After failing to convince the Commission on Elections (Comelec) to grant their petition, labor lawyer Sonny Matula and the Workersí and Peasantsí Party (WPP) have turned to the Supreme Court in their bid to have detained televangelist Apollo Quiboloy disqualified from running in the May elections.

In their petition for certiorari filed on Wednesday, Matula and the WPP urged the high court to overturn the decision of the poll body, which earlier declared as valid Quiboloyís candidacy for the Senate.

In a decision dated Dec. 18 last year, the Comelecís First Division dismissed the petition seeking to disqualify Quiboloy and cancel his certificate of nomination and acceptance, saying that the grounds presented were insufficient and lacked factual and legal basis.

In an en banc decision nine days later, the poll body affirmed the dismissal of the petition filed by Matula and the WPP as it denied their motion for reconsideration.

In their petition before the high tribunal, Matula cited the Comelecís ìdouble standard,î arguing that while the poll body had been rigid in requiring petitioners to strictly observe procedural rules, ìit has shown undue leniency, if not ignored the application of rules toward Quiboloy.î

Matula noted that despite getting a notice on Nov. 4, 2024, that required him to file an answer within five days, Quiboloyóor his representativeósubmitted a reply only on Dec. 10, or over a month late, without any valid justification.

ìInstead of penalizing this clear violation of its directive, the Comelec dismissed the petition without even a word of admonishment to respondent Quiboloy, effectively rewarding noncompliance and undermining public trust in the fairness of its rulings,î he said.

Matula also pointed out that since the founder of the religious sect Kingdom of Jesus Christ is currently detained in the Pasig City Jail for criminal cases such as qualified human trafficking and child abuse, he would be unable to conduct a nationwide campaign.

ìAllowing Quiboloy to run for office while facing such severe allegations sends a troubling message to the public. It trivializes the electoral process and undermines its purpose as a mechanism for selecting leaders genuinely committed to public service,î he said.

Quiboloy is also facing several criminal charges in the United States, including conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion; conspiracy; and bulk cash smuggling."

Maza said her senatorial campaign will be focused on programs for OFWs and poor Filipinos.

Liza Maza has called on the government to address concerns related to the environmental resources of some areas nationwide due to destructive projects, such as ecotourism and quarrying operations.

Maza particularly mentioned the provinces of Batangas and Laguna, which she visited along with fellow senatorial bet Jerome Adonis and the Bayan Muna party-list group for campaign sorties.

ìMany of these projects also cause affected communitiesí physical and economic dislocation,î Maza said in a statement on Monday.

Maza shared that she specifically visited Sto. Tomas in Batangas and her hometown in San Pablo in Laguna.

In Laguna, Maza revealed that the ecotourism industry had already caused ìserious environmental and social concerns in communities around the Seven Lakes.î

She noted the city governmentís promotion of these lakesóBunot, Calibato, Mohicap, Palakpakin, Pandin, Sampaloc, and Yamboóas tourist destinations.

ìThese projects have raised fears of forced relocation among residents around the lakes to make way for large-scale tourism infrastructure such as resorts and other facilities. Most local farmers and fishers in these communities have insecure land tenure, making them highly vulnerable to displacements,î Maza stressed.

ìThere are also concerns about privatizing access to the lakes, which could restrict traditional fishing and farming activities,î she further said.

Citing the Philippine Statistics Authority, the senatorial candidate said mining and quarrying is a P200-billion industry, which attracts local and foreign investments.

ìI strongly urge the local government of San Pablo and concerned agencies like the environment and tourism departments to listen to the peopleís legitimate issues in relation to large-scale ecotourismís impacts on the communities and environment of Laguna,î she said.

ìMarami sa ating mga kababayan sa Seven Lakes ang umaasa sa maliitang pangingisda at pagsasaka (So many of our countrymen around Seven Lakes rely on small-scale fishing and farming).

Liza Maza,"Bayan Muna, Liza Maza launch campaign for House, Senate seats in Cagayan de Oro",11-Feb-25,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/elections/bayan-muna-liza-maza-launch-campaign-cagayan-de-oro-february-11-2025/,"""CAGAYAN DE ORO, Philippines ñ Progressive party-list group Bayan Muna launched its campaign for seats in the House of Representatives with senatorial candidates Liza Maza and Amirah Lidasan in Cagayan de Oro on Tuesday, February 11.

Former Bayan Muna representative Carlos Zarate said they chose Cagayan de Oro as their launching pad for their campaign to send a political message that the party-list group ìis alive and well in Mindanao.î

Some 300 Bayan Muna leaders from various regions in Mindanao came for the launch. Among them is Lidasan, a Muslim leader from Cotabato City who is one of the Makabayan blocís senatorial candidates.

Zarate also pointed out that Cagayan de Oro is an ìEDCA site.î

EDCA, or the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, is a 2014 security pact between the Philippines and the US, which allows American forces to build facilities, pre-position equipment, and conduct rotational deployments in Philippine military bases. 

The old Cagayan de Oro airport in Barangay Lumbia has been turned into a Philippine Air Force base, and it is where US military facilities are allowed. The government has also announced plans to allow US forces to put up EDCA facilities in neighboring Tagoloan, Misamis Oriental.

Maza, a former Bayan Muna and later Gabriela party-list representative, criticized the presence of US military forces in Mindanao, under the EDCA, asserting that their presence serves American interests at the expense of the Philippinesí development.

ìAs long as US troops are here, our peopleís development will be sidelined,î she said, calling for a shift towards an independent foreign policy focused on Philippine interests.

Maza and Bayan Muna leaders also spoke against the present state of the countryís political and economic systems, which they said, benefit the elite and foreigners while leaving many Filipinos in poverty. Maza called such systems ìrotten.î

During the launch, they visited local markets and impoverished communities in Cagayan de Oro to interact with residents and tackle Mindanaoís economic struggles. 

ìIn the markets, I heard firsthand the struggles of ordinary people. The poverty here is heartbreaking. This region has the lowest wages and the highest cost of living,î Maza said. ìMindanao is rich, the country is rich. But why are millions suffering while only a few benefit from the wealth?î 

Zarate emphasized the urgency of addressing the growing gap between wages and the cost of living. 

ìMindanao workers face rising costs with stagnant wages,î Zarate said. 

Data shows the daily minimum wage in Mindanao ranges from P350 to P396, while a family of five needs over P1,100 a day for basic needs.

Another former Bayan Muna representative, Eufemia Cullamat, criticized the government for prioritizing luxury projects instead of addressing immediate needs like rising costs.

The group has pledged to push for price controls and reforms to protect low-income families and promote economic justice."""
Heidi Mendoza,Heidi Mendoza: I wonít oppose same-sex union legislation,10-Apr-25,https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/942321/heidi-mendoza-i-won-t-oppose-same-sex-marriage-legislation/story/ ,"Former COA commissioner Heidi Mendoza, who is seeking a Senate seat in the May 2025 polls, said Thursday that she will not oppose any proposed legislation on same-sex unions and apologized for hurting the feelings of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex, asexual plus (LGBTQIA+) community.

At a recent forum, Mendoza said that she was not in favor of same-sex marriage, adding that policies can be adjusted to acknowledge same-sex relationships.

In the wake of her remarks, prominent influencer Sassa Gurl withdrew her support for Mendozaís 2025 Senate bid. The two had earlier met and discussed the pending proposed sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and sex characteristic equality (SOGIE) bill.

ìTo the LGBTQIA+ community. Maraming salamat sa inyong katapangan, sa patuloy na paninindigan para sa karapatan, at sa inyong lakas ng loob na magsalita. Narinig ko kayo. At malinaw sa akin: may mga pahayag akong nakasakit at nakadismaya. Hindi sapat ang intensyon kung may tunay na epekto ang salita. For that, I offer my sincere apology and my full attention,î Mendoza said.

(Thank you for your courage, standing up for your rights, and your bravery in speaking out. I hear you/ And it is clear: I made comments that are hurtful and let you down. The intention is not enough if words cut deep. )

ìI know that for many of you, my stance on marriage feels like a contradiction to the principle of pantay na karapatan [equal rights]. And I understand why. That is why I am making this clear commitment: I will not stand in the way of same-sex unions becoming law. My job is not to impose personal doctrine. It is to serve justice,î Mendoza added.

Likewise, Mendoza outlined a four-point commitment to action plan:

to deepen her study and understanding of inclusive policy-makingóto help build systems where every Filipino, regardless of gender identity or orientation, has equal access to education, employment, healthcare, and safety;
to ensure that LGBTQIA+ voices are not only heard but empowered in the spaces where decisions are madeóespecially in her advisory team;
to actively collaborate with LGBTQIA+ organizations and human rights defendersóespecially from the grassroots and regionsó to craft policies grounded in lived realities, not just theoretical ideals; and
to remain relentless in fighting corruption.
ìRepresentation is not symbolic. It is essential to meaningful, just, and humane governance. This is not about political branding. This is about governance that is just, humane and fair,î Mendoza said.

ìThe Supreme Court has ruled that public officials are not entitled to be onion-skinned. Criticism is not an insult. It is part of democracy.

I will continue to listen. And I will not ask you to wait in silence while I grow,î she added.

Heidi Mendoza,"Heidi Mendoza tries to win back LGBT groups, says won't block same-sex union bills",10-Apr-25,"https://www.abs-cbn.com/news/nation/2025/4/10/after-backlash-heidi-mendoza-says-she-won-t-block-same-sex-union-bills-1817 
","MANILA ó Anti-corruption crusader and senatorial candidate Heidi Mendoza is trying to win back the support of the LGBTQIA+ community after she said in a recent forum that she does not favor passage of a same-sex marriage law in the Philippines.

In a Facebook post on Thursday, Mendoza said she would ""not stand in the way of same-sex unions becoming law.""

Mendoza in the post offered apologies as she acknowledged that she had issued statements that were ""hurtful"" and ""disappointing.""

She also said: ""To those who continue to question, challenge, and call me in, I hear you. I will continue to listen. And I will not ask you to wait in silence while I grow.""

WHAT SHE SAID
Mendoza, a former Commission on Audit commissioner and undersecretary general of the United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services, stressed in the campaign forum that while every person has the right to love, true love knows how to honor and respect institutions.

Same-sex marriage legislation, she added, could clash with the nation's Family Code, which states that marriage is a union between a man and a woman.

She also said there is no need for same-sex marriage to solve the problems LGBTQIA+ couples face concerning health insurance. She said these can be remedied by crafting internal policies with the insurance firms.

'PUBLIC OFFICE NOT ABOUT PERSONAL BELIEFS'
Same-sex marriage has long been a particularly controversial topic in the deeply Catholic Philippines, where even the anti-discrimination SOGIESC Equality Bill has yet to become law and has raised concerns over freedom of religion.

Mendoza said that while she would not change her beliefs overnight, she acknowledged that ""[p]ublic office is not about enforcing personal beliefs. It is about upholding the rights, dignity, and safety of all Filipinos.""

""My job is not to impose personal doctrine. It is to serve justice,"" she said.

She vowed to collaborate with LGBTQIA+ organizations and human rights groups in crafting policies ""grounded in lived realities, not just theoretical ideals.""

She said she would deepen her understanding of ""inclusive policy-making"" to ensure ""every Filipino, regardless of gender identity or orientation, has equal access to education, employment, healthcare, and safety.""

Mendoza also addressed those who share her faith ""to walk with me as we build a country where justice is not conditional, and where no one has to choose between safety and identity.""

'WILLING TO LISTEN'
Last month, a social media card produced by a university publication made the rounds online as it indicated the ""qualified no"" stance of Mendoza on the SOGIESC Equality Bill.

After meeting with content creator Sassa Gurl ó a prominent LGBTQIA+ voice on social media ó to discuss the bill, Mendoza clarified in a post on X that her ""qualified no is not a no.""

She said she was willing to listen, learn more about the SOGIESC Bill, and ""take a deeper look"" into its provisions.

Many members of the LGBTQIA+ community have expressed support for Mendoza for her anti-corruption platform and stellar background in public service but her stance on queer issues has been a source of apprehension for some of them.

After Mendoza issued her statement on same-sex marriage, some LGBTQIA+ voters, including Sassa Gurl, said on social media that they were withdrawing their support for her.

Others said they stood by her.

""I know that for many of you, my stance on marriage feels like a contradiction to the principle of pantay na karapatan (equal rights). And I understand why,"" Mendoza said in her statement on Thursday."
Heidi Mendoza,"Itís time to update confidential funds circular, says ex-COA official Heidi Mendoza",21-Apr-25,https://www.rappler.com/philippines/update-needed-circular-2015-01-confidential-funds-use-heidi-mendoza/,"""Wala pong kulay ang korapsyon, ang layunin natin ay magkaroon ng mas matibay, makatarungan, at makabuluhang polisiya ukol sa paggamit ng pondo ng bayan,' the senatorial candidate says  
MANILA, Philippines ñA 10-year-old circular that laid out regulations surrounding the use of confidential funds need to be revisited to better prevent corruption, according to former  Commission on Audit (COA) commissioner and senatorial candidate Heidi Mendoza. 

Mendoza, who was one of the COA commissioners who drafted and pushed for the approval of Joint Circular 2015-01, said that there are several parts that need to be reviewed and updated as its use has been severely abused over the past years. Doing so would help achieve greater transparency and uniform accountability, she said on X, Saturday April 19:

ìKaya alam ko po gaano kahalaga na repasuhin at palakasin ang mga patakaran [kasi] kung hindi natin ito iimbestigahan nang patas, paulit-ulit lang tayong maloloko ng sistema.î

(Thatís why I know how important it is to review and strengthen our policies because if we donít investigate things fairly, the system will just keep fooling us over and over again) 

The circular was signed in January 2015 by then-COA chairperson Grace Pulido Tan and heads of the Department of Budget and Management, Department of the Interior and Local Government, Department of National Defense, and Governance COmmission for GOCCs. 

It says that confidential spending shall only be used for activities and programs related to crime prevention and law enforcement; capability development for law enforcement personnel and volunteers; and initiatives addressing illegal drugs, illegal gambling, counterinsurgency, smuggling, human trafficking, as well as illegal logging, mining, and fishing.

Mendoza, who is running as an independent candidate, said parts that discuss ìselection and allocation, as well as accounting, recording and auditî should be reviewed. She added that all use of confidential funds regardless of amount should be investigated using a sampling method.

ìHindi po ito dahil galit tayo sa isang tao o partido, dapat patas,î she said. ìWala pong kulay ang korapsyon, ang layunin natin ay magkaroon ng mas matibay, makatarungan, at makabuluhang polisiya ukol sa paggamit ng pondo ng bayan.î 

(This is not because we are angry at a person or a political party. Things should be fair. Corruption has no color. Our goal is to have stronger, more just, and meaningful policies regarding the use of public funds.) 

The use of confidential funds has come under intense public scrutiny following revelations about how it was utilized by Vice President Sara Duterte. Her offices, including when she was education secretary, disbursed P612.5 million in confidential funds between 2022 and 2023. The controversy further escalated when reports surfaced alleging the use of fabricated or questionable receipts to justify portions of the spending."""
Joey Montemayor,Ex-presidential bet Joey Montemayor files COC for senator,1-Oct-24,https://www.inquirer.net/414487/ex-presidential-bet-joey-montemayor-files-coc-for-senator/,"MANILA, Philippines ó Former presidential candidate Jose Montemayor Jr. filed his certificate of candidacy (COC) for senator at the Commission on Elections (Comelec) on Tuesday.

ìWell, even before, I had a big chance [to win]. But now, I have a bigger advantage because I am now known,î he said.

Montemayor, who is a cardiologist and lawyer by profession, had a number of tarpaulins and placards all around the country, which he said were produced by his supporters.

ìThey are supporting a movement. Not a person but a movement that I represent ó a spiritually ready Philippines,î he said.

Montemayor has expressed his opposition to the death penalty, same-sex unions, abortion ó except for medical reasons ó and divorce, according to Vote Pilipinas, a non-profit information campaign during the 2022 polls.

He ranked tenth out of 10 presidential candidates in 2022, getting 60,592 votes, according to the Comelec.

Joey Montemayor,"VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Presidential aspirant Joey Montemayor understates COVID-19 vaccination numbers, omits context on need for boosters",11-Mar-22,https://verafiles.org/articles/vera-files-fact-check-presidential-aspirant-joey-montemayor,"Presidential candidate Dr. Jose ìJoeyî Montemayor, who is against mandatory vaccination, claimed that the number of fully vaccinated individuals in the Philippines has not reached 30 million as of early March. This is false.

Presidential candidate Dr. Jose ìJoeyî Montemayor, who is against mandatory vaccination, claimed that the number of fully vaccinated individuals in the Philippines has not reached 30 million as of early March. This is false.

His statement that COVID-19 vaccines can only ìproduce artificial immunity for three months,î hence the need for a booster shot, also lacks context.

STATEMENT
In an interview with Politiko TV channel on March 1, Montemayor elaborated on his position on the governmentís COVID-19 vaccination program.

He said in part:

ìAlam niyo po, wala pang 30 million ang napabakunahan. Inflated ang figures nila Ö E bakit kung talagang marami ó 76 million ang hindi vaccinated. In fact, ang vaccination is only artificial, it can only produce artificial immunity for three months kaya nga may booster e. Kasi kung talagang magbibigay ng herd immunity ëyan, e ëdi dapat wala nang booster.î

(You know, the [number of] vaccinated people has not reached 30 million. Their figures are inflated Ö If there is really a lot ó 76 million [people] are not vaccinated. In fact, vaccination is only artificial, it can only produce artificial immunity for three months. Thatís why there is a booster because if [vaccination] can really provide herd immunity, then there should be no booster anymore.)

Source: Politiko TV Channel, Balitang Sapol With Presidential Candidate Dr. Joey Montemayor, March 1, 2022, watch from 8:46 to 9:11

The episode of Politiko TVís ìBalitang Sapolî with the segment on the presidential aspirant was aired live on its Facebook page, which has 992,932 followers. The video has a potential reach of 1.24 million users, based on social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle.

Montemayor is running for president under the Democratic Party of the Philippines. According to his website, he is a cardiologist, a medical technologist, an economist, and a lawyer.

FACT
Data from the Department of Health (DOH) show that more than 63.30 million Filipinos ó twice more than Montemayorís claim ó have been fully vaccinated as of March 1.

The government is targeting to inoculate 80%, or around 88.8 million, of the total population of 111 million Filipinos. This means around 25.49 million of the target are either partially vaccinated or have yet to receive a single dose.



In response to the candidateís claim that the reported vaccination figures are ìinflated,î DOH said it ìstands by the collected data being released regarding the number of vaccinated individuals in the country.î

ìThis data has been collected by the National Vaccination Operation Center through lists submitted by national vaccination sites throughout the country and referenced through the Vaccine Operation System,î it said. (See VERA FILES FACT SHEET: What it takes to be ëreadyí to roll out the COVID-19 vaccines)

The agency emphasized that ìall reports undergo validation by the Centers for Health Development who are in charge of implementing, monitoring and coordinating health-related policies and programs to national government agencies as well.î

Vaccine-induced immunity
Health experts also refuted Montemayorís insinuation that protection from vaccination is only temporary, which is why the country is giving out booster shots.

A booster is an additional dose given to someone who has built enough protection after vaccination to ìre-expose [their] bodies to the part of the vaccine that protects against the disease.î

Several health agencies, including the Philippinesí DOH, have recommended boosters in view of new variants of concern, like Omicron, that could affect vaccine effectiveness.

(Read VERA FILES FACT SHEET: Why fully vaccinated people still get infected with COVID-19)

DOH and the Food and Drug Administration authorized boosters for adults aged 18 years old and above at least three months following the last dose of any of the following vaccines: AstraZeneca, Gamaleya Sputnik V, Gamaleya Sputnik Light, Moderna, Pfizer, Sinopharm, and Sinovac.

Those who received the one-dose Janssen vaccine ìcan get booster shots at least two months after their first dose,î according to the Health Department.

In a March 7 forum, Dr. Nina Gloriani, chair of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) Vaccine Expert Panel, said a third dose increases antibodies against more COVID-19 variants and prevents severe disease and hospitalization.

As of March 9, about 10.67 million Filipinos have received a third dose of the COVID-19 jab. This included 3.62 million frontliners in essential sectors, 2.07 million persons with comorbidities, 1.87 million senior citizens, 1.20 million healthcare workers, 845,819 persons who are indigent, and 1.05 million from the rest of the population.

A team of public health experts convened by Meedan, a global technology nonprofit, noted, however, that while vaccine-induced immunity is ìreducedî over time, ìimmunity is still much higher than it would be without the vaccine.î

In an email to VERA Files Fact Check, the Meedan team said: ìCOVID-19 vaccines are not only being used to prevent the infection itself, they are also being used to prevent severe illness and death. By doing so, infections go down overall.î

Although immunity can come from natural infection, Dr. Melvin Sanicas, vaccine expert and senior medical director at Clover Biopharmaceuticals, explained in an earlier interview with VERA Files Fact Check that ìvaccination induces a more robust immune response in a safe and controlled way.î

ìImmunity from the virus is very inconsistent and varies a lot from [person] to [person] because you cannot control the viral dose,î Sanicas said. (Read VERA FILES FACT CHECK: PAO chief Acosta wrongly claims vaccinated individuals ëdonít have immunityí vs COVID-19)

Health authorities continue to urge the public to get inoculated and practice physical distancing, wear masks, and maintain proper ventilation in their homes or wherever they may be to curb the spread of virus.

ìTo safely achieve herd immunity against COVID-19, a substantial proportion of a population would need to be vaccinated, lowering the overall amount of virus able to spread in the whole population,î DOH told VERA Files Fact Check in a March 8 media release.

ìWith the continuous studies and developments in the studies of our COVID-19 vaccines, there are still uncertainties with the length of protection,î it said, adding that when the country could attain ìherd immunityî remains unclear.

Subair Mustapha,"Matula, Mustapha kick off Senate campaign in Manila",11-Feb-25,https://www.inquirer.net/428358/fwd-quiboloy-foe-ballot-buzzer-beater-launch-senate-bids/ ,"MANILA, Philippines ó The labor leader who figured in a political party dispute with the camp of Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KJC) founder Pastor Apollo Quiboloy and the aspirant whose name was belatedly added in the election ballots have officially launched their campaign for a Senate seat.

Lawyer Sonny Matula and Sultan Subair Mustapha, who are running under a Workers Party of the Philippines (WPP) wing as declared by the Commission on Elections (Comelec), began their campaign in Quiapo district.

Matula went to Quiapo Church, while Mustapha also went to Quiapoís Golden Mosque before kicking off their 90-day campaign.

Both candidates are pushing for higher minimum wage, ending contractualization, strengthening workers rights, and other progressive policies.

ìAs Matula and Mustapha embark on their 90-day campaign, they call on workers, students, and ordinary Filipinos to join their fight for a just and equitable societyówhere no Filipino is forced to leave their family for the city or for another country, just to survive,î the WPP said in a statement.

Matula ran but lost in the 2022 national elections. Being the 12th member of former Vice President Leni Robreboís senatorial slate when she ran for president, Matula got more than three million votes.

 In January, Matula also challenged Quiboloyís senatorial bid before the Supreme Court (SC) in a bid to overturn the Comelec decision allowing Quiboloy to run for senator.

Quiboloy, through a representative, filed his certificate of candidacy (COC) for senator and would be running under a faction of the WPP led by the pastorís lawyer Mark Tolentino.

This triggered a controversy as the Matula-led WPP faction questioned Quiboloyís COC.

He later filed before the Comelec a petition to disqualify and declare Quiboloy a nuisance candidate, which the poll body denied.

The Comelec had also acknowledged that the WPP has two blocs with each being headed by Matula and Tolentino.

It could also be recalled that on Jan. 14, the SC issued a temporary restraining order in favor of Mustapha, who was previously declared by Comelec as a nuisance candidate.

The printing of over six million ballots already began on Jan. 6, but the Comelec had to discard it since it did not contain the names of Mustapha, which cost the Comelec  P132 million.

Subair Mustapha,"Comelec, Mustapha reject proposed No. 67 ballot assignment",18-Jan-25,https://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/comelec-mustapha-reject-proposed-no-67-ballot-assignment,"THE Commission on Elections (Comelec) and senatorial aspirant Subair Mustapha o Saturday, January 18, 2025, opposed the call of former senator Francis Pangilinan to place the name of the Workers' and Peasants' Party (WPP) candidate in the final spot on the official ballots for the May 2025 elections.

In a statement, Comelec Chairman George Garcia said it would be impossible to assign the number 67 spot among senatorial candidates to Mustapha.

""We may be accused of violating the equal protection clause of the Constitution. Additionally, the Supreme Court did not only order the inclusion of his name among the list of candidates but also to assign him the correct number based on the alphabetical arrangement,"" Garcia said.

""This may just result in another temporary restraining order (TRO),"" he added.

Garciaís statement was echoed by Mustapha, who said the directive of the Supreme Court must be followed.

""With due respect to Senator Pangilinan, we submit that no private individual has the authority to interfere. The number 47 has already been assigned to me,"" Mustapha said.

""Assigning me the last number will only add to voter confusion, as the names are arranged alphabetically,"" he added.

Earlier, Pangilinan urged the Comelec to assign Mustapha to number 67 among senatorial candidates, instead of rearranging the numbers of the other candidates and giving Mustapha number 47.

Pangilinan argued that the proposal would spare the affected candidates from the burden of incurring additional expenses related to the revision and reprinting of their election paraphernalia. (HDT/SunStar Philippines)

In a series of TikTok posted on Facebook, Olivar campaigned for organic abono for farmers, and education on proper farming methods and livelihoods.

""Ang tunay na kaunlaran ay nagsisimula sa masaganang ani at maunlad na pamumuhay, gaya ng noon kung kailan ang ating mga ninuno ay umaasa sa lakas ng kalabaw at yaman ng lupa,"" said the farmer from Ormoc, Leyte.

""Hindi lang tayo magbibigay ng suportaóituturo rin natin ang tamang paraan ng pagsasaka at kabuhayan upang masigurong pangmatagalan ang ani at asenso,"" he added.

Meanwhile, in several posts on Facebook, another senatorial candidate David DíAngelo shared his disappointment with the collapse of a bridge in Isabela, saying it was money wasted.

ìNakakalungkot [isipin] na tila naglalaho na lang parang bula ang pera ng taumbayan sa mga proyektong mukhang maganda at kapakipakinabang pero sa huli ay mukhang nagkulang sa tamang proseso at konstruksyon,î he said.

He also called on the government to defend the ancestral lands of indigenous peoples after sharing a video of their homes destroyed in Balabac, Palawan.

ìKapag tayo ay nanalo, mananagot ang lahat ng mga lumalapastangan sa mga katutubo. Hindi na kayo nahiya na ang lupang hindi naman sa inyo ay inaangkin ninyo at pinapahirapan ang mga katutubong mula noon hanggang ngayon ay nauna dyan,î he said.

Through a Facebook reel, independent candidate Angelo de Alban assured his supporters that he would not steal from the country's coffers.

He said he is willing to show his bank accounts to prove that his campaign ran on his budget and donated campaign materials from his supporters.

PDP-Laban bets

Reelectionist Senator Bong Go emphasized the government's commitment to strengthen healthcare access nationwide as he led the inauguration of the Super Health Centers (SHC) in Agno and Bani, Pangasinan.

Go also conveyed his appreciation to all healthcare workers across the country, recognizing their dedication and sacrifices, especially in underserved communities. Go reaffirmed his advocacy for more health centers and medical assistance programs to ensure that Filipinos, regardless of location, receive the healthcare they need.

Lawyer Raul Lambino took to Facebook live to address pressing national issues, particularly press freedom, education, and economic reforms. Speaking from Davao City, where he was set to attend a major youth rally, Lambino reiterated his commitment to several key issues.

He said that government officials were actively monitoring and accusing content creators of spreading misinformation while ignoring the presence of anonymous social media accounts that contribute to online discourse.

ìLalo lalo ang usaping press freedom kasi maraming nangangamba sa mga vloggers at may-ari ng pages o accounts sa Facebook, TikTok, Instagram at iba pa na sila ngayon pinagbabantaan na maaaring kasuhan sila sa pagpapakalat ng fake news,"" he said. 

(Especially on the issue of press freedom, because many vloggers and owners of pages or accounts on Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, and other platforms are now being threatened with lawsuits for spreading fake news.)

Lambino also underscored the importance of education in addressing poverty, citing his struggles in pursuing higher education. He called for curriculum reforms to keep up with global standards, highlighting the need for stronger STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education.

He also tackled the need for economic and technological advancements, emphasizing the importance of embracing digital finance, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology to improve financial transactions and reduce corruption.

Lambino, as seen on singer-songwriter and lawyer Jimmy Bondocís Facebook live, attended the Hugpong Youth Convention in Azuela Cove, Lanang, Davao City along with fellow candidates, Jimmy Bondoc, Philip Salvador, Vic Rodriguez, Senators Bong Go and Bato Dela Rosa.

Jose Jessie Olivar,"Senatorial candidate pushes for divorce, same-sex union",20-Feb-25,https://tribune.net.ph/2025/02/20/senatorial-candidate-pushes-for-divorce-same-sex-union,"A senatorial candidate vowed on Thursday to push for the passage of a divorce bill and the legalization of same-sex unions if elected to the Senate.

During the ""Harapan sa Diliman: A Senatorial Forum"" on the Equality Agenda, lawyer Ernesto Arellano argued that it is ""inhuman"" to force couples to stay in dysfunctional marriages.

""Bigyan ng mas malalim na pag-aaral ang mga senador. Mabuti siguro, palitan natin sila at iboto natin ang mga senador na bukas at naiintindihan ang divorce (Senators should study this issue further. Maybe it's time to replace them with those who are open and understand divorce),"" Arellano said.

""Isang krimen na pilitin mo yung mag-asawa na hindi na nagkakaintindihan [na magsama pa] (It's a crime to force married couples in conflict to stay together),"" he added.

Lawyer and labor leader Sonny Matula agreed on the need to end ""dead marriages"" but argued that a divorce bill is unnecessary since annulment and legal separation already exist.

""Maaari naman nating gawan ng paraan... Sa kasalukuyan mayroon tayong legal separation, mayroon tayong annulment (We can find ways... Currently, we have legal separation and annulment),"" Matula said.

Arellano, however, dismissed these options as ""useless.""

""Mas magandang putulin mo na para mag-umpisa sila ng bagong buhay (It's better to end it completely so they can start a new life),"" he argued.

Debate on same-sex unions
On the issue of same-sex unions, independent Senate candidate Jose Jessie Olivar expressed neutrality but voiced concerns about tying LGBTQ+ couples to a marriage contract, citing religious reasons and the difficulty of obtaining a divorce in the Philippines.

Arellano, meanwhile, argued that respect for love and individual rights should be taught in schools.

""Ang aking Panginoon ay mapagmahal, papayagan niya yun. Kinakailangan isama sa curriculum sa paaralan ang pagbibigay ng galang sa katawan ng isang indibidwal. Huwag kang maging marahas sa mga nag-iibigan (My God is loving; He will allow it. Respect for an individualís body should be included in the school curriculum. Don't be harsh toward those who love each other),"" he said.

The Philippines does not currently recognize same-sex unions, including marriage or civil unions. Under the Family Code, marriage is defined as a union between a man and a woman.

Background of candidates
Arellano, 83, is running under the Katipunan ng Kamalayang Kayumanggi. In 2019, he ran under the Labor Win Alliance, placing 36th out of 62 candidates with 937,713 votes. He previously served as general secretary of Kilusang Mayo Uno and co-founded various labor and advocacy organizations.

Matula, representing the Workersí and Peasantsí Party, ran for Senate in 2019 and 2022, ranking 50th and 36th, respectively.

Olivar, a transport union leader, serves as president of the Philtranco Workers Union-Association of Genuine Labor Organizations.

Senate Bill 2443, or the Dissolution of Marriage Act, which seeks to legalize divorce in the Philippines, was recommended for approval by the Senate Committee on Women, Children, Family Relations, and Gender Equality in September 2023.

Manny Pacquiao,Philippine Court Voids Manny Pacquiaoís $55.8 Million Tax Bill,"Oct. 12, 2022",https://www.taxnotes.com/featured-news/philippine-court-voids-manny-pacquiaos-558-million-tax-bill/2022/10/11/7f7hp ,"In Pacquiao v. Commissioner, the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled that Pacquiao and his wife, Jinkee, were not properly informed about the basis of the assessment, which had been issued only in the boxerís name. The decision, which was dated September 29 and made public October 7, covers tax assessments for 2008-2009.

Pacquiao, whose first name is Emmanuel, earned income in those years from boxing matches in the United States and from talent fees paid by Philippine corporations for product endorsements, advertising commercials, and television appearances. He made a timely filing of his 2008 Philippine income tax return to report his domestic income and later amended the return to include his U.S.-source income. He also filed an income tax return for 2009 on a timely basis, reporting his Philippine-source income but not his U.S. earnings for the year. He failed to file VAT returns for 2008 and 2009.

In 2012 the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) issued preliminary assessments to the Pacquiaos based on third-party information. It also filed a criminal complaint against the couple for failing to supply documents related to an investigation into alleged discrepancies on the Pacquiaosí tax returns. Although the Pacquiaos eventually agreed that VAT was due, they protested to the CTA in 2013 that the income tax assessments were defective because they were predicated on what the couple described as mere allegations that they had committed tax fraud. They also said that Jinkee Pacquiao had been denied due process because the final tax assessment was only in the name of her husband. Further, the assessments failed to reflect both the taxes that Manny Pacquiao had paid in the United States and deductions he had claimed against his income, they said.

In 2018 the CTA ordered the BIR to stop trying to collect from the Pacquiaos while their separate challenge of the assessments proceeded through the courts. The tax agency claimed the couple owed PHP 2.26 billion in income tax and VAT. Penalties and interest brought the total assessments to about PHP 3.3 billion.

In its most recent decision, which can be appealed, the CTA said the BIR lacked sufficient basis to issue the assessments because they were based primarily on news articles that were not detailed in the formal letter of demand (FLD) issued to the taxpayers. ìIt is evident from the foregoing testimony . . . that the newspaper articles and clippings which form the basis for the subject assessment were not mentioned in the FLD and that petitioners were not even furnished with copies of the said documents,î the court said. ìConsidering that the FLD failed to indicate the factual basis of the assessment and that petitioners were not duly informed of the source documents used as basis in computing the assessed deficiency taxes, the subject assessment should be declared invalid for violation of petitioners' due process rights.î

Under Revenue Regulation 7-2018, the BIR is required to provide the taxpayer with a Notice for Informal Conference, which includes the tax agencyís internal findings, before issuing an FLD. ìNo proof of service was presented by respondent to show that it was actually received by petitioners,î the court said.

Pacquiao, the only professional boxer to have won titles in eight international weight divisions, also won a seat in the Philippine Congress in 2010 and was elected to the Senate in 2016. His term expired June 30. Pacquiao came in a distant third in May 9 balloting for president in an election won by Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who has had issues of his own concerning inheritance taxes owed on the estate of his father, Ferdinand Marcos Sr. The elder Marcos was president of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986.

Manny Pacquiao,Pacquiao wins three-year legal battle against Paradigm,19-Aug-24,https://www.spin.ph/boxing/pacquiao-wins-3-year-legal-battle-against-paradigm-a793-20240819,"MANNY Pacquiao just scored a victory not on the ring, but on the court.

The three-year legal battle of the only eight-time world division champion against Paradigm Sports Management (PSM) finally came to a final decision in favor of the Filipino boxing legend.

Superior Court of the State of California County of Orange Central Justice Center Judge Walter Schwarm issued his final statement of decision last August 12, 2024, declaring the contract void owing to illegality.

According to the final statement signed by judge Schwarm, ìThe court finds for Mr. Pacquiao on the declaratory relief cause of action and declares the contract void due to illegality.î

PSM is headed by CEO Audie Attar.

The decision was a huge victory for the Pacquiao camp as it meant the ring great could fight again on US soil should he decide to unretire and seek a potential fight against reigning WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios later this year or early in 2025.

Manny Pacquiaoís US lawyer Atty. Jason Aniel said the former senator was glad to hear the courtís final decision and thanked everyone who prayed for the resolution of the legal issue.

ìWe are pleased that the court made its final decision on the legal issues in Mr. Pacquiaoís favor,î Aniel said. ìAfter hearing Paradigm Sports Managementís objections to the tentative decision, the court decided the contract that Paradigm sought to enforce Mr Pacquiao was illegal as Paradigm was not properly licensed.

Aniel added: ìThis decision negates the juryís findings back in May of 2023. We thank the courtís time and effort in this matter. Mr. Pacquiao thanks his fans for their patience while the court fully resolved all the legal issues.î

Manny Pacquiaoís MP Promotions president Sean Gibbons confirmed the latest documents from Orange County, saying the former senator did nothing wrong and that the Paradigm Sports Management contract was illegal.

ìManny Pacquiao was finally proven innocent. He did nothing wrong as the Superior Court of California has already announced its final statement of decision declaring that the contract offered by Paradigm was void due to illegality,î Gibbons said, referring to the judgeís final decision.

ìGod bless Manny Pacquiao,î Gibbons added.

The Filipino boxing legend was completely vindicated after winning the final battle on court despite the US juryís May 2023 ruling ordering him to pay $5.1 million to Paradigm broken as follows -$3.3 million for breach of contract and $1.8 million for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

But Pacquiaoís legal camp waited for the whole process to be completed, before the same judge found out that Paradigm was not licensed as a manager under the California law and nullified the juryís earlier verdict and not reverse it as earlier reported.

Irene Dumlao, spokesperson at the Department of Social Welfare and Development which is overseeing the distribution of cash aid, said the agency would cooperate with any investigation.
""There are many families who are hungry and yet billions and billions of money are being stolen in government,"" Pacquiao said in a virtual briefing, pointing to documents on his desk.
Pacquiao, 42, had long been among Duterte's strongest supporters, but is seen as a possible contender when the leader's six-year term ends next year.
""You should not be mad at me,"" Pacquiao told the president before leaving the country to prepare for a fight next month. ""I only wanted to help.""
Pacquiao alleged the intended beneficiaries of 10.4 billion pesos worth of cash aid did not receive anything, but records showed they did. ""Where did the money go?"" he asked.

Ronnel Arambulo,Philippine fishermen worry solar farm on lake will hurt incomes,12-Aug-24,https://www.khaleejtimes.com/world/asia/philippine-fishermen-worry-solar-farm-on-lake-will-hurt-incomes?_refresh=true,"A worker guts round scad before sun-drying the fish in Tondo, Manila. -- AFP file
Fishing has been a lifeline for Alejandro Alcones for the past four decades, but he now fears his small boat may be replaced by a floating solar farm on the Philippines' largest lake.
Alcones is part of a group of fishermen opposed to the government's plan to place solar panels atop Laguna de Bay, one of the country's biggest sources of freshwater fish, as it looks for renewable energy sources to meet growing demand for power.
""Laguna Lake gives life and income to fishermen like us who didn't finish school. It also gives many displaced workers here an alternative way to earn by fishing,"" said Alcones, a 55-year-old father of two who lives near the lake.
An archipelago of more than 7,000 islands, the Philippines is hampered by limited land resources as it pursues a target to produce half of its electricity from renewable sources by 2040, compared with just a fifth in 2021.
Unlike traditional solar farms on land, floating photovoltaics - or solar panels installed on reservoirs, ponds and offshore waters - are an attractive alternative for fossil fuel-dependent countries with scarce land and high population density.
Last year, Indonesia opened Southeast Asia's largest floating solar facility on a man-made reservoir.
But these novel projects may compete with people who depend on fishing and agriculture, according to a January report by the Responsible Energy Initiative of Forum for the Future, a collective of nongovernmental organisations pushing for ""ecologically safe and socially just"" renewable energy.
The report described the Laguna Lake project as a ""testing ground"" for the technology and the world's first large-scale photovoltaics operation on a natural lake.
POTENTIAL HAZARDS
Under the project, Laguna Lake, which spans 91,000 hectares southeast of Manila, will host three floating solar projects atop 2,000 hectares of water that will generate about 2 gigawatts of electricity to supply the Laguna area and the capital by 2026.
Contracts have already been awarded to three companies that must still undergo an environmental impact assessment before construction can start.
Alcones is one of the 13,000 people who depend on the lake for their livelihoods, according to the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA), a state agency responsible for the preservation, development and sustainability of the area.
The LLDA regularly meets with fisher groups to hear their concerns and the government ""doesn't want to dislocate them as much as possible"" when the solar project gets underway, said Mhai Dizon, the LLDA's renewable energy project coordinator.
But the Philippines' largest fishermen's alliance, the National Federation of Small Fisherfolk Organizations in the Philippines, or Pamalakaya, accused the LLDA of only consulting local government officials and small groups of Laguna fishermen.
Following a request by Pamalakaya, it met with the LLDA in Manila in July, when it raised concerns that the Laguna solar project could impact more than 8,000 fishermen, including 2,000 people who work in aquaculture, according to Ronnel Arambulo, Pamalakaya's vice chairperson.
""We are worried that the floating solar farms will further shrink our fishing grounds that have already been reduced by past development projects,"" Arambulo told The Thomson Reuters Foundation outside of the meeting, which was closed to press.
Fishermen from Pamalakaya fear the project would reduce catches and pose hazards to communities if they become untethered during strong typhoons and rising water levels, Arambulo said. The panels could also impede boats and destroy docks, he said.
Waterborne solar panels are still being tested and raise ""numerous questions"" about potential long-term effects on the environment and local communities, according to the Responsible Energy Initiative report.
Coastal soil erosion, increased sedimentation and siltation, disruption of photosynthesis and diminished fishing yields as the ecosystem changes are among potential risks.
""Depending on their specific location and scale, floating solar can reduce access to fishing grounds by independent fishermen,"" said Marvin Lagonera, Forum for the Future's energy transition strategist in Southeast Asia. He described a ""a rights-based approach"" in clean energy transitions as essential.
""This includes meaningfully engaging with impacted communities,"" including civil society, environmental groups and local communities, he said.
RACE FOR RENEWABLES
The Laguna Lake project would generate enough electricity to supply 2 million homes, Mylene Capongcol, assistant secretary at the Department of Energy, said in a statement.
""The Department of Energy supports the development of floating solar projects as this will contribute to the government's target of a 35% renewable energy share in the power generation mix by 2030 and 50% by 2040,"" she said. Transitioning to renewable energy is becoming ever more urgent for the Philippines.
It is now Southeast Asia's most coal-dependent country, with about 62% of its electricity production fired by the dirty fossil fuel last year, according to a report from the energy think tank Ember.
The slow adoption of clean energy is due in part to competition with agriculture for space, with just 18% of the island nation's total land deemed arable.
But floating solar panels can help defuse tensions over land rights that have plagued solar development elsewhere, research firm Rystad Energy said in a report.
At present, floating solar farms account for just 500 megawatts of power production across Southeast Asia, but another 300 MW would come online this year alone, it estimated.
""Countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand are well-positioned to be at the forefront of this growing trend,"" the report said, and pointed to the Philippines' inland lakes as suitable for solar farms.
Lagonera also saw the technology as a chance for the Philippines to accelerate its shift to green energy. ""With the Philippines' ambitious renewable energy targets, floating solar systems present an innovative alternative and opportunity to scale renewable energy,"" he said.
""However, as floating solar scales, it also risks similar competition for limited resources."" Three dozen towns whose inhabitants depend on the lake for food, water and income line Laguna's shores.
Each year, fishermen haul up to 90,000 tonnes of fish, including mudfish, catfish and ayungin, a silver perch endemic to the Philippines, from its waters.
They are also among the poorest: Almost a third of all Filipino fishers live below the poverty line. Alcones earns an average 5,000 Philippine pesos ($87) a month.
He has already seen a decline in the quantity and variety of fish and blames stresses on Laguna arising from its use as a flood reservoir and waste sink, as well as for irrigation and hydropower.
The LLDA believes the floating solar farms could actually boost Laguna fisheries in the future.
""Based on studies Ö the bottom of the panels can be used as breeding ground for fishes,"" Dizon said.
While some Laguna fishers have welcomed the solar project, others believe they have more to lose than gain.
""We recognise the energy transition or the shift to renewables. But this should be put up in areas that are no longer productive, unlike Laguna Lake,"" Arambulo said."
Ronnel Arambulo,"Fisherfolk-leader condemns demolition of Bataan fishing community
 Fisherfolks, Human Rights",28-Sep-24,https://philippinerevolution.nu/angbayan/fisherfolk-leader-condemns-demolition-of-bataan-fishing-community/,"ambansang Lakas ng Kilusang Mamamalakaya (Pamalakaya) fisherfolk-leader Ronnel Arambulo expressed solidarity against the demolition of a fishing community in Sitio Kabilang Ilog, Orion, Bataan on September 25. This is the third time the local government of Orion has implemented the eviction of the residents.
At least 26 fisherfolk families have been evicted from Sityo Kimil Ilog since August 12. The Manila Bay-facing community is still recovering from the effects of the oil spill and successive typhoons and rains caused by the southwest monsoon.
ìWorse than disregarding the fisherfolkís plight, the Orion Town Leader Mayor Antonio Raymundo and the fascist police even colluded to disposses the fisherfolk of their livelihood and homes,î Arambulo said. These issues are not new to Arambulo as he has long been a fisherman in Laguna de Bay.
The local government carried out the demolition under the guise of implementing the Supreme Court Mandamus on the cleaning of Manila Bay. The residents do not believe in this reason because they know that they are being evicted for the planned business to be built in the area.
The fisherfolk-leader condemned the local government for misusing the order. He said, at the heart of cleaning Manila Bay should be the rehabilitation of fishing resources for the benefit of fisherfolk and not a few nor the businesses. ìOur houses and especially the fisherfolk are not trash for them to clean them and sweep away,î the fisherfolk-leader added.
In 2023, Erigon Marketing and Development Corp sent the Sitio Kimil Ilog residents a letter evicting them to make way for its business in the community. The eviction and demolition of the community began on July 7, 2023. Some residents were forced to agree and evacuate while others stood up for the right to housing.
Residents said that the ìcleaning up of Manila Bayî is clearly just a pretext to evict them especially as corporations continue to operate along the Bataan coastline. There are still widespread reports of reclamation, quarrying and disposal of polluted and contaminated water into the sea.
Arambulo supported the residents. ìThe glaring fact is that the worst destruction of the fishery takes place through continuous reclamation, quarrying along the coasts of Bataan,î he said.
Amid the demolition and attack against the fisherfolkís livelihood, there is no other answer but firm unity and reliance on their fellow oppressed and exploited.
These issues are among those that Arambulo will highlight as a Koalisyong Makabayan senatorial candidate in the 2025 election. He will also oppose reclamation, campaign against Chinese bullying and for asserting the rights of fisherfolk in traditional and territorial fisheries, and other issue of the fisherfolk in the election theatre."
Ronnel Arambulo,Fisherfolk leader is Makabayan's fifth candidate for the Senate,20-Aug-24,https://philippinerevolution.nu/angbayan/fisherfolk-leader-is-makabayans-fifth-candidate-for-the-senate/,"Mangingisda naman! (Fisherfolk for a change!) This was the cry in Navotas on August 19 when Ronnel Arambulo of Pamalakaya announced that he would run for senator in the 2025 election. His announcement was made in the fishing community on P. De Vera St in the city, whose livelihoods is facing demolition to allow the reclamation project of San Miguel Corporation. Fellow fisherfolk, workers, urban poor, farmers and indigenous people, as well as the youth, attended his rally.
Arambulo has been fighting for more than two decades, first as a youth activist, and later as a fisherfolk activist. A native of Rizal, he came from a poor family of fisherfolk in Malakaban, Talim Island, Binangonan. He became a youth and student leader and member of Anakbayan in the mid-2000s. In 2007, he became a member of Pamalakaya. He served as chairman of Anakpawis Partylist in Binangonan and was elected provincial leader of Anakpawis-Rizal. He also served as councilor of Barangay Makalaban for six years. He is a fisherman in Laguna de Bay. At the age of 48, he now stands as Pamalakayaís vice chairperson.
As a Pamalakaya official, he led the resistance of coastal communities against reclamation, privatization and other forms of conversion on waters and oceans. Recently, he has been part of protests to assert the fishing rights of Filipino fisherfolk who are being prohibited by China. At the same time, he stands for the expulsion of American forces from Philippine maritime territory.
ìIn the West Philippine Sea, Filipinos are continuously restrained from fishing by the increasing military presence not only of China, but also of its rival countries such as the United StatesÖ In other major fisheries such as Manila Bay, etc. calamities suffered by fisherfolk as a result of reclamation and other forms of privatization is prevalent,î Arambulo said.
ìFsherfolk representation is as important as representing the working class. It is important to propagate the true situation and clamor of the sectors that are the foundation of the economy and society,î Kilusang Mayo Uno stated.
ìItís time we have a real voice that will carry the agenda of the fisherfolk and farmers to the Senate. All peasant women support Ronnel Arambulo because he is a consistent defender of the rights of fisherfolk and he fights for national sovereignty,î Cathy Estavillo, Amihan general secretary and Gabriela Womenís Party consultant on issues related to women farmers, said.
ìIn the face of the ongoing and worsening threats to our oceans, fisheries, and coastal communities due to environmental plunderówhich has made fishermen the poorest sectoróitís time for the fishing sector to have a representative in the Senate,î said the Kalikasan Peopleís Network for the Environment, which endorsed his candidacy. ìBeyond their vital role as producers of our food, fishermen are at the forefront of defending our oceans and marine life.î
The Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas also expressed support for Arambulo. It said representatives like him who are from the grassroots sector are needed in the Senate to promote progressive laws and reforms for the well-being of the majority. ìA new politics of change is needed as an alternative to the current rotten politics dominated by dynasties,î it said.
ìWe are proud to welcome Ronnel Arambulo to the Makabayan senatorial slate,î Makabayan co-chairperson Neri Colmenares said. ìHis extensive experience as a grassroots leader and tireless advocate for the rights of fisherfolk makes him an invaluable addition to our team.î
ìKa Ronnel Arambulo can count on the vote of thousands of Navotas fisherfolk,î fisherfolk under Pamalakaya-Navotas declared. ìWe will tirelessly campaign for him. Because his victory is our victory!î
Arambulo is Makabayanís fifth candidate. Along with Rep. France Castro, Rep. Arlene Brosas, Ka Jerome Adonis and former Rep. Liza Maza, who earlier announced.

Arambuloís candidacy was announced on August 19 by PAMALAKAYA in a program in Navotas City with the call ìMangingisda naman sa Senado!î (Time for fisherfolk in the Senate.)
A fisherfolk in Laguna de Bay, Arambulo has been a local leader since 2008, advancing the rights and welfare of the countryís poorest sector as well as leading grassroots campaigns in defense of coastal communities and fishing grounds against reclamation, conversion and privatization.
Arambulo said his Senatorial bid is to advance the agenda of the fisherfolk sector for sovereign and fishing rights. 

ìI welcome the challenge of the Makabayan Coalition to be part of its senatorial slate in order for us to further advance the rights of the fisherfolk sektor,î Arambulo said.
He noted that there had been no one from their sector who dared participate in national elections, especially as the fisherfolk had been suffering from extreme poverty.
ìIn the West Philippine Sea, Filipinos are prevented from fishing by the increased presence of Chinese and even United States military. There must be someone in the Senate who would push that we rid of foreign military presence in our territory,î he said.
Arambulo added that he will make accountable those responsible for calamities and reclamation wreaking havoc in fishing grounds such as Manila Bay.
Poor fisherfolk from Rizal
A staunch champion of Filipino fishing rights within the territorial waters and the countryís exclusive economic zone (EEZ), Arambulo worked alongside fellow fisherfolk in Zambales and other parts of Central Luzon in demanding foreign powers leave Philippine waters. 
He also led protest actions at the Chinese Consulate to denounce the Chinese governmentís continuing blockade and harassment of Filipino fisherfolk in the West Philippine Sea.


Arambulo led the collective fishing expedition last May off the waters of Masinloc, Zambales in defiance of Beijingís unilateral fishing ban declaration.
Last month, he helped organize the fluvial protest action off Subic, Zambales to mark the eight year of the arbitral ruling in the South China Sea.
Arambulo was a former six-year councilor of Barangay Malakaban, Binangonan, Rizal.

Ronnel Arambulo,Ronnel Arambulo: From a shy fisherman to a Makabayan Senatorial bet,31-Mar-25,https://www.bulatlat.com/2025/03/31/ronnel-arambulo-from-a-shy-fisherman-to-a-makabayan-senatorial-bet/,"By SHAN KENSHIN ECALDRE 
CABUYAO, Laguna ñ When one envisions a senatorial candidate, Ronnel Arambulo is unlikely to be the first person who comes to mind. He does not hold a degree, has no deep pockets, and is a soft-spoken man with skin weathered by years of fishing under the sun. Yet, what he carries is far more valuable: unwavering principles and a genuine heart for the people.
Ronnel Gondraneos Arambulo, vice chair of fisherfolk group PAMALAKAYA, announced his 2025 Senate bid under the Makabayan coalition on August 26, 2024, in Navotas City.
Who is Ronnel Arambulo?
Born on May 18, 1976, in Binangonan, Rizal, Ronnel is a fisherman, activist, and advocate for fisherfolk rights and environmental protection.
Coming from a family of fishermen, he witnessed firsthand the struggles of his community. 
From a young age, he understood the harsh realities of making a living from the lake, shaping his deep connection with the working-class sector.
During his teenage years, he became curious about activism after hearing stories from a fellow villager who was an activist from UP Los BaÒos.
Working student 
In 1995, with financial support from his aunt, Ronnel enrolled at the University of Manila, taking up Criminology.
ìI was still fishing while studying. My parents couldnít afford my education, but my aunt, who was better off financially, decided to support me,î he recalled.
ìI havenít shared this with many people, but I once dreamt of becoming a policeman. However, when I became a Junior Police Officer in Manila, I witnessed the ugly realities of the system,î he told Bulatlat.
By 1996, due to financial struggles and the exhausting commute, he dropped out of college to help his parents make ends meet.
ìStudying in Manila was too expensive, and we needed money to survive,î Ronnel said.
After leaving school, he returned to fishing, then worked as a garment worker, and took jobs in factories to support his family.
Discovering activism
In 2005, after nearly a decade, his aunt once again supported his education. This time, he enrolled at the University of Rizal System (URS) in Angono, taking up Secondary Education major in Filipino.
It was at URS where Ronnel encountered Anakbayan, a youth-led activist organization. Intrigued, he approached the group and expressed his interest in joining.
ìAt first, they barely noticed me, which surprised me. I initially thought activists were highly esteemed individuals, but I soon realized that joining such movements required genuine dedication. Eventually, they welcomed me, and I became involved,î he said.
Despite joining a progressive organization, Ronnel remained a silent and shy person. ìEven in college, I was still shy. My parents were the same way because we came from a simple fishing background.î
However, by 2006, financial difficulties forced him to drop out once again. He lived for some time in the office of a mass organization, actively participating in their activities. Eventually, he returned home to focus on providing for his family.
Organizer and labor activist
In 2007, Ronnel worked in a garment factory in Binangonan. There, he witnessed unfair labor practices, including delayed and unpaid wages.
ìAt first, I was just another worker, but after some time, I also stopped receiving my salary,î he recalled.
Seeing the injustices in the workplace, Ronnel took a stand. He organized his fellow workers and led protests to demand their rightful wages. ìI spoke with the workers, and many agreed to take action because they were suffering too,î he said.
With the help of a trade union, legal action was taken against the factory management. At one point, the factory owner attempted to bribe Ronnel to abandon the movement, but he refused. In the end, the management was forced to pay the workers their salaries..
ìThere were still unresolved labor issues, but the workers decided not to push further. They were already satisfied with the wages they received,î he said.
Joining Pamalakaya and defending fisherfolk rights
It was also in 2007 when Ronnel encountered Pamalakaya, an organization dedicated to fisherfolk rights.
Like his experience with Anakbayan, he approached the group and expressed his desire to join. However, due to the organizationís busy schedule, particularly with election-related activities, he had to wait before being formally accepted.
Ronnel volunteered for Pamalakaya until he was eventually welcomed as an official member.
Among his most eye-opening experiences was participating in fact-finding missions, where he witnessed the plight of the urban poor, youth, and indigenous communities.
ìI joined fact-finding missions. I encountered cases of disappearances and killings,î he said.
Kind hearted
According to his partner Edilyn, Ronnel is a kindhearted man who, despite having little, is always willing to help others.
ìHe genuinely cares for people. You know the saying, ëEven if itís your last bite, youíll give it awayí? Thatís him,î his partner stated.
During his free time, Ronnel enjoys gardening, cooking, and singing.
ìI love tending to plantsóit helps relieve stress, especially when they start growing. I also sing with my partner,î he shared.
Francis Magalona and Yano are his favorites. He also finds inspiration in music, from Francis Mís Ito ang Gusto Ko and Nilamon ng Sistema to Gloc-9ís  Upuan, Salarin, and Martilyo.
Beyond rap, he also likes progressive songs such as APLAYAís music on fisherfolk struggles and songs of resistance like Isang Daang Taon and Dakilang Pakikibaka.
His wife, his first love, sometimes worries about his safety due to his activism. However, she fully supports his cause and understands why he does it.
Why run for the Senate
Ronnelís decision to run for the Senate is not driven by personal ambition but by the long-standing struggles of fisherfolks and the need to protect the countryís waters and marine resources.
ìWhat pushed me to run is the continuous neglect we fisherfolk have experienced under past and present administrations,î he said.
He aims to fight against destructive projects that threaten the livelihoods of coastal communities and advocate for environmental protection and fisherfolk rights.
ìWe are considered the ëpoorest of the poor.í Itís time for fisherfolk to have representation in government,î he said.
For Ronnel, politics is not about poweróit is about service, justice, and dignity for the working class.
What keeps him going
Ronnel recalled a quote from the late Ka Eden Marcellana, a human rights activist killed in 2003: ìIt is difficult to live a normal life in an abnormal society.î
These words deeply resonated with him, reinforcing his belief that turning away from injustice wonít make it disappear. Fisherfolk, farmers, and workers must fight for their rights because those in power refuse to provide real solutions.
Despite the risks activists face, Ronnel believes action must come before fear.
ìFear never truly disappears, but you choose to keep going because what we do matters,î he said. (RVO)"
Ronnel Arambulo,Fisherman Ronnel Arambulo Braves the Turbulent Tides of the Senate Race,5-Feb-25,https://phkule.org/article/1389/fisherman-ronnel-arambulo-braves-the-turbulent-tides-of-the-senate-race/,"
Under the banner of the Makabayan slate, the fisherman campaigns to protect the countryís waters from exploitation and ensure food security for all.


Ronnel Arambulo arrived by his boat to greet me at Binangonan Port, dressed in his signature blue outfit. It was seven in the morning and some fisherfolk were already out in the lake trying to get their dayís catch. I climbed aboard his boat and, while traveling across the water, he pointed toward all the spots fish frequented and taught me the methods to catch them. 
We settled on a quiet bank where we discussed his life as a fisherman-turned-aspiring-senator. There, he shared his passion for organizing, fishing, and singing. I listened to him sheepishly perform a rendition of Ewan by APO Hiking Society, its lyrics altered to mock the Maharlika Investment Fund.
For 48 years, Ronnel has roamed the shifting waters of Laguna de Bay, his hands toughened by decades of steering boats and casting nets. Experience granted him knowledge of every aspect of the lake, from the best fishing spots for certain seasons to the all-too-familiar issues that ail its waters.
But now, Ronnel confronts the tides of a sea he has not yet traversed before: the Senate race. Under the banner of the Makabayan slate, the fisherman campaigns to protect the countryís waters from exploitation and ensure food security for all. 
 
A Life by the Lake
Born in 1976 to a family of fisherfolk in Binangonan, Rizal, Ronnel was practically raised by Laguna de Bay and would often accompany his folks on fishing trips. The lake became his playground and Ronnel was one of its troublemakers, hitching rides on passenger boats before getting scolded.
Despite being a rambunctious child, Ronnel still appreciated the gifts of the lake. By the shore, he and his friends would scavenge torn and discarded gillnets then set them up in the water. The richness of the waters was such that, with even little effort, it provided them with fish to take home later that afternoon. 
ìYung mga mangingisda noon kahit sa maikling oras lamang, three to four hours, kaya na i-sustain ang pangangailangan,î Ronnel said.
It was in this small town that he began dating Edilyn, his childhood friend. ìSimula po kabataan talaga siya na ëyong tinibok ng aking puso,î Edilyn said.
But their young love did not initially last. Personal differences caused them to part ways, then unexpectedly reunited again in Laguna in 2017. Ronnel and Edilyn interpreted this as the work of destiny, eventually opting to continue their relationship and get married.
The childhood sweethearts settled down in their hometown of Binangonan. Their house would be filled with music as Ronnel enjoyed guitar, singing, and songwriting as hobbies. Still, he spent most of his time in the lake hauling fish to sustain his family.
ìSi Ronnel kasi, masipag na tao at talagang dedicated ëyan sa pamilya. Syempre bilang mangingisda, ayon po ëyong kinabubuhay namin,î Edilyn said.
Over the years, Ronnel specialized in a type of fishing called ìtibogî. He demonstrated the technique while I rode with him on his boat by first untangling and scattering the nets in a circle. You can tell a genuine fisherman by the ease in which they cast their nets, he remarked. With a long pole, Ronnel disrupted the water and gathered the fish into the trap.
However, Ronnel explained that the quality and quantity of his catches have declined compared to when he was a child. 
He realized that the lakeís deterioration began with the introduction of ìdevelopmentî projects such as the Napindan Hydraulic Control Structure in 1983. It was intended to control saltwater intrusion but the deprivation of saltwater from the brackish lake proved detrimental to its ecosystem with 20 species no longer present since its construction, according to fisherfolk rights group Pambansang Lakas ng Kilusang Mamamalakaya ng Pilipinas (PAMALAKAYA). Now, the dam merely diverts floodwater from Metro Manila to Laguna de Bay, which contributes to flooding and pollution in coastal areas. 
Such challenges caused long days with catches too insufficient to even pay debt. ìNaalala ko pa sa isang lending, ang hulog namin doon araw-araw sa panahon na iyon nasa 120 pero minsan nakakahuli ka lang nasa 100 pesos, so kulang pa doon sa utang mo at doon sa pakain mo sa pamilya mo, so kailangan mo ulit mangutang,î Ronnel said.
During that time, Ronnel was still unaware of the reason underlying the prioritization of such destructive projects. But that all changed when PAMALAKAYA organized in his barrio to explain the issue of dredging projects under former President Gloria Arroyoës administration. 
Ronnel was initially hesitant to listen to the fisherfolk groupís discussions, believing the dredging to be nothing more than clearing mud from the lakeís bed. Gradually, he understood the actual motive for such a projectóto deepen the lake and allow ferry boats inside its waters, commercializing the area.
These realizations willed Ronnel to join PAMALAKAYA as a full-time organizer in 2007. ìNapalalim pa [ako] sa mga iba-ibang isyu hanggang sa naging bahagi na rin ako sa pagpapaliwanag sa mga bagay na iyon,î he said.
 
Political Undercurrents
Ronnel began his activism by joining protests and making accompanying props before taking an interest in educational discussions. He frequently conversed with PAMALAKAYA Chairperson Fernando Hicap about their understanding of fisherfolk issues. 
Hicap saw his potential as a discussion instructor, but Ronnel felt himself to be shy and reservedótraits he still struggles to overcome to this day. He was soft-spoken, his voice occasionally drowned out by the passing waves while we talked, yet his words carried the weight of the reality of his sector. Over time, however, he felt comfortable enough to share his knowledge and analysis of fisherfolk issues with his community. 
After all, Ronnel experiences these firsthand. Right next to where we were talking by the shore, Ronnel pointed to the land being reclaimed under the expressway project Laguna Lakeshore Road Network. The erected dike has made the community, including his home, prone to flooding, worsened the lakeís water quality, and disturbed fish in the area, he said. 
As of 2024, there are at least 239 proposed and ongoing reclamation projects in the country. More than 25 million Filipinos are at risk of displacement from these projects, with fisherfolk harvests already declining to as much as 86%, according to an investigation by Altermidya.
ìMagkakalayo lang ang mga mangingisda, pero di sila magkakaiba ng sitwasyon,î Ronnel said.
In response to these threats, Ronnel has organized alliances by rousing communities around Laguna Lake such as in Calamba and Muntinlupa. These efforts led to the relaunched Save Laguna Lake Movement, formed to oppose the lakeshore project. 
Ronnelís fight for fisherfolk rights began long before his Senate campaign, representing them in dialogues with local governments and hearings with legislative committees tackling reclamation projects in Laguna. Due to these efforts, he eventually became the chairperson of PAMALAKAYA Rizal for a time before being elected as vice chairperson of PAMALAKAYA National.
These advocacies are intimately tied to the interests of the Filipino people at large, Hicap believes. ìAng issue ng mangingisda, issue nating lahat. Yung pagtatanggal sa ating pangisdaan, yung pagpapanatili sa kanya as pangisdaan na source, yung pagkain natin, ay para rin sa Pilipino at sa susunod na henerasyon,î he said.
 
An Upstream Battle
Protecting fisherfolk livelihoods is critical, but the road to genuine representation is not without its obstacles. Ronnel grapples with numerous challenges, both personal and campaign-related, in his bid for a Senate seat.
As a senatorial candidate, Ronnelís schedule is packed with campaign activities that whisk him away from his hometownóa drastic difference from his quiet life as a fisherman and family man. He travels frequently among communities, rallying people behind his cause. When he is not on the road, Ronnel juggles studying the fundamentals of lawmaking and media engagements, such as video messages and interviews.
Ronnel tries to muster all the support he can get because he faces stiff competition in his fight for change. Prominent political names and established dynasties vying for the same Senate seat possess the capital and machinery for campaigning, yet Ronnel still believes he has an edge through the peopleís backing. ìNaniniwala tayo na mas tayo ang nakakaalam ng kalagayan ng mga mangingisda, ng mga mamamayan kasi tayo mismo nasa grounds,î he said.
Time was a resource highly demanded from Ronnel that often left Edilyn without his presence for weeks to even months. At times, she was tempted to sulk about their lack of time together, but understood the importance of his husbandís goals and the necessary sacrifices to achieve them. ìKaya kapag nandito siya, [sa pagluluto] niya binabawi lahat ng oras na wala siya,î Edilyn said.
Outside his home, Ronnel experiences other challenges in the form of state harassment. In 2022, an individual claiming to be maritime police went directly to his home and attempted to bribe Ronnel, demanding the fisherman stop his organizing and become an informant. But Ronnel did not sell his cause. 
This was not his first time encountering state suppression. In 2010, police arrested Ronnel after he campaigned against demolition efforts in Lupang Arenda, Taytay. For three days, he was interrogated and accused of terrorism before being released due to mounting public pressure.
Now, the state is attempting to hinder the whole Makabayan bloc in their election efforts by charging illegal assembly raps against 10 of their candidates, including Ronnel. The charges stemmed from a peaceful rally they participated in during Bonifacio Day on Nov. 30, 2025.
Despite these threats, Ronnel remains steadfast in continuing his senatorial campaign. ìKung meron ka dapat ikatakot, [iyon] ay mapanatili ang ganitong klaseng sistema na siyang nagpapahirap sa mangingisda at sa mamamayan,î he said, his conviction supplanting his usually reserved demeanor.
In the turbulent tides of politics, Ronnel charts his course to a Senate seat, undeterred by threats. The same resilience that has guided him through long days o"
Ernesto Arellano,"Senatorial bets bare platforms for youth, women, LGBTIQ+ in UPD forum",27-Feb-25,https://up.edu.ph/senatorial-bets-bare-platforms-for-youth-women-lgbtiq-in-upd-forum/,"Eight senatorial candidates in the 2025 midterm elections showed up to share their views on women, LGBTIQ+, and youth issues in ìHarapan sa Diliman: A Senatorial Forum on the Equality Agendaî at the UP Diliman School of Statistics Auditorium on February 20.
The forum, attended mostly by students and teachers from higher education institutions in Metro Manila, served as a venue for candidates with smaller campaign machineries to articulate their platforms on gender-based issues on education, health, labor, and economics, and to give voters a glimpse at the kind of legislation they are proposing so as to reform present national policies. The candidates who responded to the organizersí invitation were: labor sector leaders, Leody de Guzman (Partido Lakas ng Masa) and Atty. Sonny Matula (Workers and Peasants Party); an animal and human welfare advocate, Norman Marquez (independent); an urban poor advocate, Jose Olivar (independent); a reform advocate, Atty. Ernesto Arellano (Katipunan ng Kamalayang Kayumanggi); a teacher and PWD advocate, Atty. Angelo De Alban (independent); an anti-crime crusader, Atty. Arnel Escobar (Partido Maharlika); and an environmentalist, Roy Cabonegro (Democratic Party of the Philippines).

The eight candidates were also asked to share their views on marriage and divorce, and fighting corruption and political dynasties, and on their plans for promoting diversity, equity and inclusion in schools and workplaces.
Cabonegro, who has more than 25 years of experience in development work as an environmental activist, said that they are running against political dynasties and traditional politics. In response to a question on the delivery of gender-based health services, he emphasized that government should ensure that adequate health care, particularly for HIV and AIDS cases, is available to the people and that this should not be dependent on foreign support. On the issue of providing more protection against online exploitation, cyberbullying and misinformation, he said parents and guardians should be enabled to monitor their childís online activities; while internet services providers should also have a more pro-active role in preventing such abuses.
Escobal, a graduate of the Philippine Military Academy and a retired police general, said he offers good governance and anti-corruption platforms. He added that he favors free education, supports cooperatives, and the expansion of coverage of the countryís universal health care policies. He also said the laws on violence against women and children (VAWC) should be expanded to include LGBTIQ+ relationships.

Arellano, known as a lawyer for urban poor and informal settler families, said government should focus on creating employment opportunities through industrialization and higher wages. He said he supports incentivizing companies that will promote diversity, equity and inclusion policies. On the issue of enacting a divorce law, he expressed support for it.
Olivar said he advocates integrated development of the urban poor, farmers, and workers. He said workers should be regularized so that they can form or join unions. On the issue of delivery of health services, he said the countryís health care system should be strengthened, and health care professionals should be given higher salaries so that they will not look for jobs abroad. On the issue of legislating civil unions for LGBTIQ+ couples, he said that he is not against such partnerships but would also not favor marriage, in general.

De Alban, who highlighted that independent leaders should serve with integrity as inspiration for the youth, said he will prioritize in the Senate the needs of persons with disabilities (PWD) and children with special needs. He added that the Family Code should be amended and the courts should be given adequate support as the judiciary is a co-equal branch of government. On the issue of discrimination in workplaces and schools, he emphasized the need for comprehensive policies to create safe spaces and promote gender-fair languages. He also proposed legislating more support for mental health services and ìright to careî for LGBTIQ+ couples.
Marquez, who said he will stand up for the oppressed, supported the creation of education policies which aim to increase awareness to protect women, LGBTIQ+, and youth. He added that parents and teachersí associations (PTAs) should be mandated to have appropriate trainings as well as adequate facilities (such as comfort rooms) as priorities. On the issue of violence against women and children (VAWC), he expressed the need for more protection against cybercrimes and for enabling free legal assistance for victims through their respective school or barangay. On the issue of education reforms, he added that: teachersí salaries should be increased; K-12 policies, revised; more schools and equipment, provided; and scholarships and free education, expanded for low-income students.

Matula, Chairperson of the Nagkaisa Labor Federation, said he is focusing on: legislating decent wages for workers; institutionalizing scholarship for children of workers and peasants; promoting industrialization; and ending the countryís contractualization policy. On the issue of divorce, he said the country already has policies for annulment and that these can be liberalized to render the marriage null and void.
De Guzman, also a known labor leader, highlighted the need to defend workersí rights to form unions, to legislate the end of contractualization as a policy, as well as to end political dynasties, and to impose taxation for the ultra-wealthy or create a ìwealth taxî policy. He also supported the call for increasing awareness of the mental health and other needs of PWDs, and the need for adequate facilities for them.

Solidarity messages for the event were delivered by: Sejal Tiwari, Second Secretary (Political) of the Embassy of Canada to the Philippines; Myrna Jimenez, Secretary General of Sarilaya; Professor Maria Ela L. Atienza, representing UP sa Halalan and the Department of Political Science in UP Diliman; and Vince Liban, National Convener of PANTAY. Media personalities, Angela Lagunzad-Castro and Jervi Li (also known as KaladKaren), served as forum moderators.
The forum was co-organized by PANTAY, UP sa Halalan, COMELEC, the Philippine Political Science Association, and Sarilaya, as an initiative ìto mainstream gender and youth issues as electoral concerns and position gender minorities as electoral forces.î"

Roberto Ballon,"Long before experts sounded the alarm bells on depleting mangrove forests, Roberto Ballon, fondly called ìKa Dodoy,î and his fledgling group of fishermen were already knee-deep planting mangrove trees in their coastal community of Concepcion in the Municipality of Kabasalan, Province of Zamboanga Sibugay.",12-Apr-22,https://theaseanmagazine.asean.org/article/roberto-ka-dodoy-ballon/,"Ka Dodoy recognised early on that the mangrove ecosystem must be preserved for marine life to flourish and serve as a constant source of food and livelihood for his community. It drove him to organise the Kapunungan sa Gagmayng Mangingisda sa Concepcion (KGMC) [Association of Small Fisherfolk of Concepcion] in 1986 and form partnerships with government agencies and nongovernment organisations. His decades-long  leadership and efforts  to restore and manage the mangrove cover and protect the coastal resources of his community earned him the prestigious 2021 Ramon Magsaysay Awards (Asiaís version of the Nobel Prize).
ìBefore the 1980s, our environment was idyllic and unspoiled. Fish was plentiful and easy to catch. Our fishing grounds were close to shore, and so we did not have to spend hours paddling into the sea or spending too much on  fuel. Our parents, grandparents settled here because of this natural abundance. But by the mid-80s, we were venturing farther out into the sea to get a good catch. Our mangrove cover was shrinking. Illegal fishing was rampant. Dynamite fishing was poisoning our fishing grounds. The use of fine-mesh fishing nets was also common. Mangrove areas were getting converted into fishponds. The rest were being cut down and sold or turned into coal. Without mangroves, fish stocks and other marine life lose  their shelter and cannot lay eggs or feed.  As our mangrove cover diminished, so did our marine resources, such as crabs, prawns, and fingerlings. We were losing our food and livelihood sources. So most of us had to move farther offshore to catch fish, costing us a lot of money, gasoline, and time.
As our mangrove cover diminished, so did our marine resources, such as crabs, prawns, and fingerlings. We were losing our food and livelihood sources. So most of us had to move farther offshore to catch fish, costing us a lot of money, gasoline, and time.
ìThese issues pushed other fishermen and me to form KGMC. We wanted to protest against these illegal activities and bring them to the attention of the authorities. The organisation that helped us form KGMC, called the Catholic Church Social Action Ministry, taught us how to approach and seek help from the government. That is what we did. We approached the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and our local government unit. But instead of helping us, we ended up shelling out money to secure legal documents. We were losing so much money but going nowhere so many were discouraged. Our members dwindled from 30 when we first started to just five in 1997-1998. We decided to just act on our own. And so we started planting mangrove trees. I thought maybe when the government sees our efforts and how committed we are, it will eventually extend help.
ìEven with dwindling membership, the organisation was able to restore about 50 hectares of mangrove cover. This was based on DENRís assessment in 2000. In the reforested areas, we started laying fish traps (gillnet, baklad, bubo) and we were harvesting a good amount of crabs, fish and oysters again. I was the first to go into oyster farming in the 90s. Then later, with loans, I started lapu-lapu (grouper) culture. Our former members started to notice that our efforts were bearing fruit and they wanted to join the association again. They wanted to go into aquaculture as well, but the problem was that they wanted access to capital without the proper preparation or doing the hard work. I told them they could do this as well, but they had to put in the work. They thought the government just gave money and thatís it, but the local government advised them to continue protecting the mangroves and look at what Iíve done as a ëmodelí for fish farming.
ìWe were able to enter into a co-management agreement with the DENR and the local government unit, covering 47 hectares of mangrove areas in Kabasalan Municipality. We actually initiated the process with the help of the Forest Foundation Philippines and Xavier Agriculture Extension Services. We drafted the resolution and wrote a letter of intent. We have demonstrated that we could protect our mangroves even without government support, but we wanted an instrument that would make it official and strengthen our position so we can fully protect our coastal environment.
ìWhat is the impact of all our initiatives and advocacies? We always hear the terms poverty reduction and inclusive growth, but how are they really measured? For me, change should be visible. In our case, it is very plain to see. Before, our members used paddle-driven boats, but since theyíre now earning good income from fishing, they have been able to replace these with motorised fishing boats. They now have appliances at home, and their houses, including their bathrooms, are now made of sturdier materials. Their children all go to school, and they have gadgets for online schooling. Most importantly, our members are able to save, so even if they were unable to fish for three days or even a week, they would not starve.
ìWe have introduced KGMCís initiatives to the rest of Zamboanga Sibugay, and even in other areas like Palawan province, Quezon province, Bicol region. We shared our experiences and taught them what we know. We want other coastal communities to do what we do and thrive as well.
We always hear the terms poverty reduction and inclusive growth, but how are they really measured? For me, change should be visible.
ìThe three most important lessons we try to impart are, first, focus on environmental protection and management, especially, the restoration of mangroves. Second is livelihood and enterprise development. They should develop their potential and enhance their marketing, aquaculture, and farming skills. Third, they should embrace the spirit of bayanihan and strengthen their organisation or cooperative. No one wins if each goes his/her own way. It is also easier to get government support if a group is well-organised. Government agencies are more willing to provide assistance for initiatives that will benefit the whole organisation.
ìOther than mangrove restoration and protection, KGMC is implementing or involved in other activities as well. For example, we conduct bantay-dagat (sea patrol). We also provide regular training on marketing and fish farming in cooperation with government agencies.
ìOur women and youth members have a savings club. Our youth members are part of the Youthís Involvement in Enterprise and Learning Development or YIELD program. They post online and sell our products, such as crabs, oysters and other seafood, usually after school hours, after their online study. They earn while they use their gadgets. They earn while studying.
ìWe also implement a ëtrash for cashí initiative. Before, trash was everywhere, but because of our program, people became obsessed with collecting trash. Each sack of trash collected is equivalent to a raffle ticket.
ìWhen the Ramon Magsaysay Foundation called me to say I won (the Ramon Magsaysay Award), I thought it was a prank. It wasnít until I did some research that I learned who the past winners were. I could hardly believe that I was chosen for this award since Iím not a doctor or a scientist. But, once it sank in that I won, my entire family and community were grateful and honoured. It was a recognition of our work, which some people have questioned. They would say, ëwhat will you get out of planting mangroves?í Iím happy that the Foundation is willing to recognise the good work of ordinary people. I am inspired by this award, and I will make sure that it will not go to waste. It validates the work of other fishermen in the country and elsewhere in Asia who are doing the same thing. Through this award, the fishing profession has also regained the respect of other people.
ìOur work is not yet done. We still need to help a lot of fishermen in our community. We need to give them training, organise them, or strengthen their organisation. The government should fully support mangrove reforestation and coastal protection initiatives all over the country. There should be a law that mandates the government to invest in environmental protection and set up programs for small fishermen, programs that will organise, capacitate, and give capital to organisations  and cooperatives. The Philippines has the fifth longest coastline, yet we donít have a Department of Fisheries, unlike our neighbouring countries like Viet Nam and Indonesia. We are also supposed to be the center of marine biodiversity, but we donít have concrete programs to take care of it and our fishermen. There are talks about importing fish. We have not even maximised our potential for aquaculture, especially in Mindanao.  Government should invest in hatcheries, post-harvest services, aquaculture training, feeds industry, bangus (milkfish) production, multispecies fishery. We will end up exporting fish if the government invests in these. 
ìIn the past, fishermen would tell their children, ëstudy hard so that you wonít end up becoming a fisherman or farmer.í This message is wrong. We should be telling our children, ëstudy hard so you can become a professional fisherman or farmer so that someday, we have the capacity to export rice and fish.í"

The Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation recognized Ka Dodoy for his ìinspiring determination in leading his fellow fisherfolk to revive a dying fishing industry by creating a sustainable marine environment for this generation and generations to come, and his shining example of how everyday acts of heroism can truly be extraordinary and transformative.î 
In 1986, Ka Dodoy and other fisherfolk organized KGMC to address overfishing and mangrove destruction in Sibuguey Bay, one of the two bays in Zamboanga Sibugay. The bay is under the jurisdiction of the following municipalities, namely Tungawan, R.T. Lim, Ipil, Naga, Kabasalan, Siay, Payao, Talusan, Alicia, and Olutanga. It supports one of the Philippinesí richest fish populations and is estimated to supply fish for the 330,000 Sibugaynons inhabiting the area. Realizing that the only way to ensure the economic wellbeing of the member fisherfolk is to protect and conserve the mangrove forests in the area, Ka Dodoy led the mangrove protection and conservation initiatives in Kabasalan.
In 2007, Forest Foundation Philippines partnered with the Xavier Agricultural Extension Services (now Xavier Agricultural Extension Services Foundation) to support KGMC and other Peoplesí Organizations (POs) for mangrove rehabilitation activities in Sibuguey Bay. It has resulted in the reforestation of about 71 hectares of denuded mangroves and abandoned fishponds. A total of 374 fisherfolk were also trained in coastal resource management, nursery establishment, and sustainable aquaculture enterprise development. 
This project provided the impetus for KGMC to continue the rehabilitation efforts in Kabasalan, while the Xavier Agricultural Extension Services Foundation supported other fisherfolk in Ipil. From 2008 to 2015, Forest Foundation Philippines awarded grants to KGMC to continue its mangrove reforestation efforts, supporting about 550 fisherfolk in the improved management of at least 600 hectares of  mangroves in the municipalities of Kabasalan, Naga, Siay, and Alicia. A significant key to the successful mangrove reforestation was the innovation on the propagation of Pagatpat (Sonneratia alba) seeds done by Ka Dodoy, with technical guidance from the Forest Foundation. This seed propagation paved the way for massive production of quality seedlings that are appropriate to the planting sites. 
In 2012 and 2013, Forest Foundation Philippines, in partnership with Condura, organized the Condura Skyway Marathon: Run for the Mangroves, which enabled runners to donate mangrove seedlings to sustain the reforestation efforts in Sibuguey Bay. 
In 2013, KGMC and 33 other fisherfolk organizations formed a federation named COMFAZS, that is duly-registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ka Dodoy serves as Chairperson of COMFAZS. It enabled the scaling-up of efforts on mangrove management, forest protection, capacity-building, livelihood development and advocacy on coastal resources management, which was also supported by the Forest Foundation.
An inspiring story of hope, KGMCís conservation journey has also been featured in the Office of the Vice Presidentís Istorya ng Pag-asa Film Festivals, a nationwide, all-digital film competition for short documentaries featuring the extraordinary stories of ordinary Filipinos. These projects prove that forest-dependent communities do not have to choose between conserving the forests or earning a decent living. "
Roberto Ballon,Senatorial bet Roberto Ballon eyes more jobs in agri-fishery industry,9-Apr-25,https://www.inquirer.net/435853/senatorial-bet-roberto-ballon-eyes-more-jobs-in-agri-fishery-industry/,"MANILA, Philippines ó Senatorial candidate and Ramon Magsaysay awardee Roberto Ballon on Wednesday said that he would push for programs to create more job opportunities in the agri-fishery industry in the country.
Ballon made this statement in a forum by Multiply-Ed Philippines when asked what changes he would do to address the unemployment crisis and make the K-12 curriculum effective.
Ballon pointed out that despite the Philippines being an archipelagic and agricultural country, the government continues to import products.
ìWhy donít we develop our agri-fishery program? It is not being funded enough and taken seriously. If we have a food shortage, we import,î he said in Filipino.
Stable job opportunities
He also noted that many college graduates do not have stable job opportunities because their environments are not developed enough.
ìWhat I will push is to create laws and programs to create more jobs, especially in the agri-fishery and forestry industry program and policy. I will push for the Magna Carta of the Young Farmers in the Philippines,î he added.
Ballon, a fisherman, received a Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2021 for his role as a secretary of a fisherís confederation in Capiz, which focused on rehabilitating mangrove forests and fought to end destructive fishing methods.
He also won the Equator Prize of the United Nations Development Programme in 2023 for his efforts to protect the environment.
According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the number of unemployed Filipinos decreased from 2.16 million in January to 1.94 million in February. The labor force participation rate, or Filipinos aged 15 years and above actively looking for jobs, was reported at 64.5% in February."

In 2021, he was conferred the Ramon Magsaysay Award for ìhis inspiring determination in leading his fellow fisherfolk to revive a dying fishing industry by creating a sustainable marine environment for this generation and generations to come.î

In a Facebook reel posted on Tuesday, Ballon can be seen braving the slight rain while aboard a small boat approaching the shore.

ìAndito yung ating mga kababayan na nakikipaglaban... Kaya andito tayo, at nagbabalik muli ang ating kababayan sa Bugsuk,î said Ballon.

Roberto Ballon,Ka Dodoy: ëServing the people without conditions is the true treasureí,12-Jul-24,https://www.upv.edu.ph/index.php/news/ka-dodoy-serving-the-people-without-conditions-is-the-true-treasure,"Roberto ìKa Dodoyî Ballon, 2021 Ramon Magsaysay awardee and the 45th University of the Philippines Visayas (UPV) Commencement Exercises speaker, said serving the people without conditions is the true treasure.
Ballon shared how his genuine service and persistence transformed the coastal community of Consolacion in Kabasalan town, Zamboanga Sibugay in his message to the UPV Class of 2024, Class Haraya during the graduation rites held at the UPV Covered Court on July 9, 2024. 
Fluent in five local languages, Ballon mentioned in Tausug the three ìTsî needed to serve the people ñ ìtime, talent, and treasure.î Of the three, the last T is the most important as the true treasure of happiness is obtained when serving the people. 
Decades before Ballon was recognized for his leadership and advocacy, he attended several seminars and underwent training where he learned the reason for their concerns on food security and protection of aquatic resources ñ the coastal communityís depleting mangrove cover. 
Ballon organized the Kapunungan sa Gagmay'ng Mangingisda sa Concepcion or KGMC in 1986 to educate people on mangrove reforestation. He remained persistent in his advocacy despite the heavy skepticism and little support because of the underwhelming initial returns. 
ìMy community may not have reaped instant benefits from the mangroves, but it is actually through this advocacy that people in my community were able to establish their livelihoods, at the same time, their involvement became their own key to improve their respective lives,î Ballon said. 
ìIt is important that we pursue efforts that are sustainable, including a sustainable livelihood for everyone in the communityî he added, mentioning that monetary aid to the community is not for the long-term. 
In his message, Ballon shared that one is not required to have multiple PhDs to serve the people. He does, however, consider himself a ìPhDî or a ìperson with high dedication,î which is why he was able to serve his coastal community. 
Ballon also recognized that while a degree is not a requirement to serve, attaining such would enhance pursuits to serve for the greater good. 
ìHindi natin kailangan ng mataas na degree. Pero, alam niyo, mas lalo na kung may narating tayo habang nagseserbisyo, kapag may degree tayo, mas lalo pa dapat natin na pagbutihin ang pagseserbisyo sa mga tao at sa ating pamayanan,î he said. 
He closed his message by telling Class Haraya to focus on their strengths and hone their crafts after graduating to better serve the people."
Roberto Ballon,Hand-in-Hand: Roberto Ballonís Call for Sustainable and Climate-resilient Livelihood and Communities,23-Nov-22,https://asianfarmers.org/hand-in-hand-roberto-ballons-call-for-sustainable-and-climate-resilient-livelihood-and-communities/,"Empowerment, dedication, and collaboration ñ these three things, as Roberto Ballon Jr. narrated, continuously keep the fire burning for him and his fellow farmer fisherfolks to fulfill their calling in attaining a sustainable and resilient agricultural sector.  
While putting his achievement as one of the 2021 Ramon Magsaysay Awardees on the sideline, Roberto ìKa Dodoyî Ballon Jr. took pride in the achievements of his fellow fisher farmers in Zamboanga, Sibugay. In his message during the last day of the event series to commemorate the tenth general assembly and the twentieth-year anniversary of the Asian Farmers Association for Sustainable Rural Development (AFA)ís 10th General Assembly and 20th Anniversary Celebration last October 2022, Ka Dodoy recalled the milestones of fisher farmer organizations and federations on attaining environment protection, restoration, and management.  
Mangrove Reforestation and Sustainable Livelihood
ìSo currently, our project aims not just to provide more livelihood in the country in our community. But mostly, we would like to provide [a] safe, healthy, and peaceful environment, especially this climate change,î said Ka Dodoy as he shared the efforts exerted by their organization, the Kapunungan sa mga Gagmayíng Mangingisda sa Concepcion (KGMC), in partnership with different institutions, to continuously attain mangrove reforestation. Across the 13 coastal municipalities in Zamboanga, Sibugay, he stated that they have planted mangroves and protected an estimated area of 7,000 hectares of mangroves. 
This has enabled them to produce different food products from mangrove crops and asuhos fish, which Ka Dodoy emphasized came back to the coastal areas since the mangroves have been restored. 
The caught asuhos, Ka Dodoy shared, were produced into dried fish for their organizationís enterprise. He then walked the participants through their ongoing initiatives. Aside from mangrove reforestation, he also showcased their organizationís enterprise as their sustainable livelihood project for their farmersí community. With aquaculture as their main activity, he shared that they are currently cultivating and processing lapu-lapu and shells, specifically oyster or talaba. One of their achievements through the enterprise, as Ka Dodoy narrated, is to innovate by coming up with value-adding products ñ not just to sell their catch, but to process and sell them at a higher price. 
Despite these milestones, Ka Dodoy still put at the forefront how their livelihoods are suffering from the impacts of climate change. Though they are able to adapt and innovate, he still calls upon and challenges the government for help to combat the natural calamities that devastate their source of income. He also emphasized the immediacy of bringing relief and accessing Peopleís Relief Funds in times of calamities. 
With the agricultural sector as the most vulnerable to these natural calamities and the impact of climate change, Ka Dodoy calls for the utmost attention and support from his fellow farmers and fisherfolks from the government. 
ëCo-LOVE-orationí, dedication, and empowerment
To be able to fulfill their calling as farmers and fisherfolks to provide sustainable and safe food and livelihood, as well as resilient communities against the impact of climate change, Ka Dodoy added the most important goal of their organization: people empowerment, or as he called it, the ìcoastal people community empowerment.î
Ka Dodoy shared that aside from the livelihood opportunities that their enterprise can offer to its members, they also participate in training and seminars that can hone their skills as fishermen and leaders of their own communities. 
And to sustain the ongoing projects and programs they conduct, he also zeroed in on leading with dedication. Ka Dodoy imparted that not being able to finish a degree is not a hurdle, but continuously becoming a person with high dedication is a key to keeping one going in what heís doing. 
Closing his message, he left the participants a challenge to ìco-LOVE-orate.î ìCo-LOVE-orate,î as he explained, is a play of the words ëcollaborateí and ëlove.í ìWithout this ëco-LOVE-orationí ñ partnership with love ñ we will not succeed [in] our intention to combat this varied climate change and especially to combat what is, what we would like to happen as fisher farmers. So thatís why thatís one of our callings for attention [to] our leaders not only in our country, but in [the] whole Asia, but maybe in the whole global and the wholeÖ this planet.î
As sustainability and resilience come hand-in-hand, people and nations should also come hand-in-hand ñ collaborating and partnering towards the same goal of achieving sustainable food and livelihood, as well as climate-resilient communities. #"
Roberto Ballon,Harapan 2025: Fisherfolk advocate Ka Dodoy vows to counter SC decision on commercial fishing,21-Feb-25,https://www.abs-cbn.com/news/nation/2025/5/8/digital-voting-breeds-distrust-among-overseas-filipino-workers-1039,"MANILA ó Fisherman and Ramon Magsaysay Awardee for environmental conservation and community development Roberto ìKa Dodoyî Ballon, Jr. vowed to craft laws for the benefit of his fellow fisherfolk who were affected by a Supreme Court ruling that favored commercial fishing vessels.
On ABS-CBNís ""Harapan 2025"" with Ron Cruz, Ballon decried the ruling of the high courtís 1st Division that affirmed the decision of the Malabon Regional Trial Court allowing commercial fishing operations within 15 kilometers of municipal waters.
ìNgayon, kung tuluyan nang pasukin dahil pinayagan na ng 1st Division ng Supreme Court, so ano ang mangyayari sa amin, iyon ang kinakaharap naming problema ngayon,î Ballon said.
(Now, if these commercial fishing operations come in because the 1st Division of the Supreme Court allowed it, what happens to us? That's the problem we're facing now)
Ballon won the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2021 after he spearheaded mangrove reforestation in Zamboanga Sibugay.
He told ABS-CBN that while he respects the decision of the high court, he will use his position for the welfare of fisherfolk, farmers and indigenous people, if elected to the Senate.
ìIyan po ang tututukan natin na gagawa tayo ng mga batas o paiigtingin natin ang mga batas na nagpo-protekta sa ating katubigan, sa ating kalikasan para sa kapakanan ng mga mamamayan, lalo na sa mga mangingisda, magsasaka at mga katutubo,î Ballon said.
(That will be our focus. We will file laws or strengthen existing laws that protect our waters and the environment for the benefit of fishers, farmers and indigenous peoples)
Asked why run for senator and not for party-list representative, Ballon said he just responded to the clamor of his fellow fisherfolk and the situation they live in.
ìSo itong 2.3 million na mangingisda ay naghihirap, sila ang tumulak sa akin o nag-endorse sa akin kasama ang mga magsasaka at katutubo na mahihirap para bosesan sila sa Senado kung tayo ay papalarin,î Ballon said.
(So the 2.3 million fishers are suffering. They are the ones who pushed me... or endorsed me, along with the farmers and IPs to be their voice at the Senate if I am fortunate)
Ballon plans to address climate change, considering that his sector is among those badly affected during typhoons.
He said the country needs a climate financing initiative that can be used in anticipation of climate-related weather events like typhoons.
Ballon hopes that his campaign platform will resonate with his fellow poor Filipinos.
ìWalang nakaintindi sa putak ng manok kundi manok lang, walang nakaintindi sa mihe ng kambing kundi kambing lang so dapat ang pinapaupo na boses nila, representative dapat galing sa kanila, at nakikita ano talaga ang nangyayari sa baba,"" he said.
(Only a chicken will understand a chicken's clucks. Only a goat will understand another goat's bleating. So the people's representative should be from among them and sees the plight of those at the bottom)
""Kaso lang ang nangyayari ngayon pinipili ng mga manok ó ibig sabihin ng manok yung mahirap iyon na tao, isang kahig isang tuka nga eh, manok ó ang pinipili nila, buwaya, so kinakain pa sila,î Ballon said.
(But what usually happens is the chicken ó by that, I mean the poor ó choose crocodiles that end up eating them)"
Roberto Ballon,Filipino Roberto Ballon is 1st fisherman recipient of Ramon Magsaysay Award,17-Sep-21,https://www.goodnewspilipinas.com/filipino-roberto-ballon-is-1st-fisherman-recipient-of-ramon-magsaysay-award/,"Filipino fisherman and environmentalist Roberto ìKa Dodoyî Ballon has been named the recipient of the 2021 Ramon Magsaysay Award, widely regarded as the Nobel Prize of Asia.
Ballon was announced as one of the five awardees of Asiaís premier prize and the highest honor given by the Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation (RMAF) on August 31, 2021.
The 53-year-old fisher from Zamboanga Sibugay was recognized by the awards body for ìleading his fellow fisherfolk to revive a dying fishing industryî and ìcreating a sustainable marine environment for this generation and generations to comeî.
ìI am grateful to the Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation for choosing me and giving me this huge honor as a fisherman,î Roberto Ballon said in Filipino after being elected to receive the honor.
ìI dedicate this also to all fishermen, especially the small fisherman across the Philippines. And because of this, let us keep improving and strengthening our programs,î Ballon continued.
ìHopefully because of this, more people will know and support our programs for the small fisherfolks in the Philippines.î
In 1986, Ballon and thirty other fishermen started Kapunungan sa Gamay nga Mangingisda sa Concepcion (KGMC) or the Association of Small Fishermen of Concepcion.
Seeing how rampant fishpond conversion was and how the abandonment of the fishponds when the business had collapsed and destroyed the mangrove forests, Ballon and his group established KGMC to focus on mangrove reforestation.
Ballon and his groupís perseverance attracted government support and they were granted tenurial rights to the reforested land under a government forestry co-management program. The 50 hectares they replanted by 1994 had expanded to 500 hectares of mangrove forests by 2015.
The KGMC now has a membership of 320 households and the groupís success has led to other projects. In partnership with the municipal government, KGMC members were also deputized to conduct the local Bantay Dagat or Sea Patrol volunteer program, aimed at protecting municipal waters from illegal fishing and mangrove logging.
KGMCís initiatives have been replicated in other towns in Zamboanga Sibugay and beyond, giving new life to Kabasalan, now regarded as the seafood capital of the province and an ecotourism destination.
Ballon and this yearís Ramon Magsaysay Awardees from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Southeast Asia will receive their awards at the Ramon Magsaysay Center in Manila on November 28, 2021.
Established in 1958, the Ramon Magsaysay Award celebrates the memory and leadership example of the seventh Philippine president after whom the award is named and is given every year to individuals or organizations in Asia who manifest the same qualities of the late and beloved Filipino leader.
Previous Ramon Magsaysay Awardees from the Philippines include the Philippinesí National Artist for Music Ryan Cayabyab, Former Philippine Ambassador to the Holy See and Malta, Howard Q. Dee, Filipino dancer and academic Ligaya Fernando-Amilbangsa, and former ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales.

Abby Binay,Mayor Abby kakasuhan ang Taguig City dahil sa takeover ng pasilidad,7-May-25,https://www.net25.com/news/mayor-abby-kakasuhan-ang-taguig-city-dahil-sa-takeover-ng-pasilidad,"Handa si outgoing Makati City Mayor at senatorial candidate Abigail ìAbbyî Binay-Campos na magsampa ng kaso laban sa city government ng Taguig bunsod ng biglaang takeover sa mga  pasilidad sa EMBO barangays noong Martes.

Isinagawa ang takeover ng mga kawani ng Taguig City gamit ang hawak na temporary restraining order na inisyu ng isang hukom sa lungsod.


ìMarami po kami ifa-file na kaso hindi lang po sa sasagot kami sa kanilang summon. May pending na pong kaso ito,î ayon kay Mayor Abby.

Inilahad ng alkalde na hindi pinigilan ng Makati City ang ginawa ng Taguig dahil sumunod lang ang mga kawani sa court order.

Ayon sa mayora isang taon nang nakasara ang mga pasilidad ngunit noong Lunes lang naisipan na mag-file ng kaso.

ìIsang taon na po iyang nakasara. 1 year and 5 months. Noong Lunes lang nila naisipan na mag-file ng kaso, 1 week before the election kaya nakakuha sila ng TRO hanggang Friday,î ayon kay Abby.

ìHindi sinabi ng Korte na kanila na ang pasilidad at masyado malayo ang interpretation nila na ang asta nila ay parang sila na ang may-ari. TRO lang naman ang nakuha nila. Kami naman ay sumusunod lang,î paliwanag ni Binay."
Abby Binay,"AGENDA NI ABBY, SA KORTE MAKAPAGHIGANTI?",8-May-25, https://remate.ph/agenda-ni-abby-sa-korte-makapaghiganti/,"AMINADO si Makati City Mayor Abby Binay na kabilang sa kanyang agenda sa pagtakbo sa Senado ang makapaghiganti sa Korte Suprema dahil sa desisyon nitong ibigay ang pamamahala sa 10 EMBO Barangay, na nasa ilalim dati ng kanyang kapangyarihan, sa Taguig City,
Sa kanyang pahayag sa campaign rally sa CEMBO ni Congresswoman Pammy Zamora, sinabi ni Binay na pinag-isipan niya ang pagtakbo bilang senador at sa kanyang pagmumuni-muni ay napagdesisyunan niyang umangat ng pwesto tutal naman ay matatapos na ang kanyang termino bilang alkalde ng lungsod ng Makati.
Sinabi ng batang Binay na ang desisyon ng Supreme Court na ipagkaloob ang 10 EMBO barangay sa Taguig City ang hurisdiksyon ay nagpaiyak sa kanya ng sobra-sobra dahil wala nga siyang magawa maliban sa umiyak araw-araw.
Aniya, gusto na niyang mag-quit. Pero sa mga palatandaang nakita niya, naisip niyang tumakbo sa pagka-senador upang maiakyat ang isyu sa Mataas na Kapulungan hinggil sa desisyon ng Korte na ibigay ang 10 EMBO barangay sa Taguig City.
Giit ng alkalde ng Makati City ìDadalhin natin ang laban sa Senado.î
Noong Mayo 5, nagpalabas ng Temporary Restraining Order ang Taguig City Regional Trial Court na inuutusan si Mayor Binay na alisin ang lahat ng sagabal sa paggamit ng lahat ng government owned facilities ng 10 EMBO barangay.
Nakasaad din sa ipinalabas na kautusan ng korte na ìfinal and executoryî ang desisyon ng SC na kumukumpirma na sakop na ng Taguig City ang Barangay Cembo, South Cembo, Comembo, East Rembo, West Rembo, Pembo (kabilang ang Rizal), Pitogo, Post Proper Northside, and Post Proper Southsideóna kilala bilang EMBOs.
Kaya nga sakop na rin ng Taguig City ang lahat ng pasilidad ng nasabing mga barangay tulad ng health centers, covered courts, multi-purpose buildings, day care centers, parks, at iba pang nakalaan sa public use.
Matapos kasing magpalabas ng kautusan ang SC noong 2022, hindi tumalima si Binay sa kautusan at sa halip ay isinara ng Makati City ang ilang ilang health centers at day care centers kaya hindi nagamit ng taga-EMBO barangay ang pasilidad na dapat sana ay nakapaghatid ng serbisyo sa mga mamamayan ng nasabing mga barangay."

Jovee Marie N. de la Cruz",7-Mar-25,https://businessmirror.com.ph/2025/03/07/abby-binay-wants-more-funds-for-pagasa-to-improve-climate-forecasting/,"PILI, CAMARINES SUR ñ A senatorial candidate is pushing for increased funding to the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (DOST-PAGASA) to enhance climate forecasting capabilities and support the agriculture sector.
Makati Mayor and senatorial candidate Abby Binay emphasized that better climate forecasting would be crucial for farmers and the agriculture sector, which continue to suffer from extreme weather conditions.
ìClimate change is already here. Weíve been talking about rising temperatures for years, but funding for important programs like Project NOAH has been cut, leaving us unprepared when disasters strike,î she said in a press conference.
She highlighted the importance of timely and accurate weather forecasts in mitigating climate-related damages.
ìMore funding for climate forecasting could help us give early warnings to farmers and communities about extreme weather so they can take necessary precautions,î she said. 
Binay said tackling climate change requires resilience, which is built on data and forecasting. 
ìWithout proper data, weíre flying blind,î she said. 
She said increased funding to support DOST-PAGASAís climate data collection and forecasting services would be beneficial in the long term.
 ìLetís invest in data, forecasting, and resilience to protect our future,î  Binay said. 
According to the Department of Agriculture, 98% of agricultural production losses from 2013 to 2022 are due to climate-related hazards. Total agricultural production loss due to climate-related events has been pegged at P229,848,889,131. 
The DA also said rice is the most climate-damaged crop with an accounted loss of 36% or some P108 billion. 
Typhoons are also responsible for 88% of total damages and are regarded as the most destructive climate-related hazard to agriculture, the department said. "

ìRemember, itong ilang araw na ito parang gusto nila akong pasikatin. Siguro may isang tao na ayaw akong nasa Senado,î Binay said.
ìThey filed a new case last Monday, today is Wednesday. Nag-file sila ng kaso ng Monday, pinasok nila ang health center ng Tuesday, nag-open sila ng health center nila today, pero ang TRO nila ay hanggang Friday lang,î she added.
Binay said the timing of Taguigís move to take over the health centers in the Embo barangaysómore than a year and five months lateróis also concerning.
ìWhy did you wait a week before the elections to file a case and get a TRO and get possession of the health centers? If you are truly concerned for your constituents, dapat as early as January 2024 nag-file na kayo ng kaso at ininsist ninyong makuha ang possession ng property,î Binay said.
Binay also reiterated that the Supreme Court decision only pertained to territorial jurisdiction, not ownership of lands.
ìLetís go back. The Supreme Court decision is not about ownership. It is about territorial jurisdiction. Hindi sinabi ng Korte na lahat ng pagmamay-ari ng lungsod ng Makati ay mapupunta na sa Taguig,î Binay said.
She also pointed out that Taguigís refusal to obtain a Writ of Execution was the root cause of the continuing dispute.
ìThe reason why this case has been dragging on is because Taguig refuses to get a Writ of Execution. Di ba iyon lang naman iyong pinag-awayan namin noong umpisa pa lang? Kung may Writ of Execution, alam natin kung paano i-implement iyong Supreme Court decision, pero hanggang ngayon walang writ. Kaya magulo,î she explained.
Binay said Makati is set to file a number of cases, saying that the properties that Taguig has taken over are worth around P1.8 billion, but the court has required them to post a bond of only P20 million in favor of Makati.
Meanwhile, Binay said that the vote-buying complaint filed before the Comelec was malicious.
ìThe complaint misrepresented a portion of my speech during the rally. I was referring to Rep. Pammy Zamoraís statement that she will provide more funding for the Ospital ng Makati,î Binay added.
She said that it was not vote-buying but a commentary on a campaign promise.
ìThere is nothing unlawful in this statement, since it was merely referring to a candidateís promise to provide funding for services, which is typical during a campaign season,î Binay said.
Binay noted that she has yet to receive a formal copy or a show cause order from Comelec as of press time."
Abby Binay,Abby Binay questions timing of TRO vs. Makati over EMBO barangays,7-May-25,https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/945340/abby-binay-questions-timing-of-tro-vs-makati-over-embo-barangays/story/,"MALOLOS CITY, Bulacanó Outgoing Makati City Mayor Abby Binay on Wednesday questioned the timing of the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO), prohibiting them from taking full and exclusive possession of public properties in the EMBO barangays.

ìPara lang sa iyong kaalaman, lahat ng ëyan ay nangyari in the span of one week. A week and a week before the election,î Binay said during the press conference of Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas here. 

(Just for your information, all of that happened in the span of one week.)

ìThey filed a new case last Monday. Today is Wednesday, nag-file sila ng bagong kaso Monday. Pinasok nila ang health center ng Tuesday, nag-open sila ng Health center today pero ang TRO nila hanggang Friday lang. I question the timing because the health centers have been in that condition for one year and five months,î she narrated. 

For Binay, it is puzzling that the TRO was secured a week before the May 12 elections.

ìWhy did you wait a week before the elections to file a case and get a TRO and get possession of the health centers. If you are truly concerned with your constituents, dapat as early as January 2024, nag-file kayo ng kaso at in-insist niyong makuha ëyong possession ng property,î she quipped.

(You should have filed a case as early as January 2024 and insisted on getting possession of the property.)

Binay, a lawyer, also reiterated that the Supreme Court decision ìis not about ownership,î but about territorial jurisdiction.

ìHindi sinabi ng korte na lahat ng pagmamay-ari ng lungsod ng Makati ay napupunta na sa Taguig. Ang sinabi lang ng Supreme Court, [the disputed areas] ay parte na ngayon ng Taguig. ëYon lang,î she said.

(The court did not say that all the property of the city of Makati now goes to Taguig. The Supreme Court only said, [the disputed areas] are now part of Taguig. Thatís all.)

Binay then slammed the Taguig City government for its refusal to get a writ of execution, which she thinks was the root of all of these issues.

""Kung may writ of execution, alam natin kung papaano i-implement ëyong Supreme Court decision pero hanggang ngayon walang writ kaya magulo. So, hindi ko po kasalanan ëto,î Binay said. 

(If there is a writ of execution, we know how to implement the Supreme Court decision, but until now there is no writ, so there is confusion. So, this is not my fault.)

Cayetano's response

Taguig Mayor Lani Cayetano, meanwhile, posted a video on her Facebook page on Wednesday and spoke about the TRO.

""Malinaw ang utos ng korte, nasa hurisdiksyon ng Taguig ang EMBO barangays at dapat makinabang ang mga tao sa pasilidad na matagal ng ginawa naman talaga para sakanila,"" Cayetano said.

(The court's order is clear: the EMBO barangays are under the jurisdiction of Taguig, and the people should benefit from the facility that was built for them a long time ago.)

""Walang anuman paikot-ikot na pagpapaliwanag, pangmamaliit sa akin at sa Taguig, masasakit na salita at panglilito ang puwedeng gawin ni Mayor Abby Binay at Atty. Certeza ang puwedeng magtago sa katotohanan,"" she added.

(There is no way that Mayor Abby Binay and Atty. Certeza can hide the truth by using roundabout explanations, belittling me and Taguig, using hurtful words, and causing confusion.)

""Ngayong araw, nagbubunyi ang mga residente ng EMBO, sigaw nila, salamat at nabalik na ang mga pasilidad na sakanila naman talaga.""

(Today, the residents of EMBO are rejoicing; they are shouting, Thank you, and the facilities that are rightfully theirs have been returned.)

TRO

The Taguig City Regional Trial Court (RTC) issed theTRO prohibiting Makati and any of its personnel from preventing Taguig from taking full and exclusive possession of public properties in the EMBO barangays on Tuesday.

In its order, the RTC said the TRO is effective for 72 hours.

ìThe Court finds that plaintiff has sufficiently established extreme urgency for the present application, and that it stands to suffer grave injustice and irreparable injury without the injunctive relief prayed for,î the RTC said.

It ordered the Clerk of Court and the Taguig RTC ex-officio Sheriff to serve the summons to Makati, as well as a copy of the order, and to file a return.

Taguig said the covered facilities include health centers, covered courts, multi-purpose buildings, day care centers, parks, and other government properties reserved for public use under Proclamation Nos. 518 and 1916.  óVAL, GMA Integrated News"

","A COMPLAINT has been filed before the Commission on Elections (Comelec) against Makati Mayor and senatorial candidate Mar-Len Abigail ìAbbyî Binay and incumbent Taguig Second District Representative Amparo Maria ìPammyî Zamora over vote-buying allegations.
Binay and Zamora were accused of violating Section 261 (a) and (b) of the Omnibus Election Code and Section 26 (p) of Comelec Resolution 11104, which prohibit vote-buying and conspiracy to bribe voters.
In the complaint-affidavit, Binay, during her speech at a political activity in Taguig City, introduced Zamora as her ìcounterpart in Congressî and said, ìSo mamaya po, magsasalita po si Cong. Pammy papakitaan niya kayo ng mga limpak-limpak niyang pera dahil marami siyang pondo. Hehehehe. Yari ka, Pammy.î
The complainant said that the statement, made in the context of a campaign rally, created a reasonable expectation of monetary reward among voters in exchange for supporting Zamora in the upcoming elections.
The affidavit emphasized that under the law, actual distribution of money is not required for a vote-buying offense to be consummated, noting that it is enough that candidates or their representatives make offers or promises of money or other benefits to influence voter behavior.
ìThis act of coordinated communication is a clear violation of election laws and an attempt to manipulate voters,î the complainant said.
Under the Omnibus Election Code, conspiracy to bribe voters is a punishable offense, even if no money changes hands, which carries a penalty of one to six yearsí imprisonment, disqualification from holding public office, and deprivation of voting rights.

Mayor Abby Binay advocates for nationwide replication of Makatiís healthcare and education successes
January 8, 2025

Makati City mayor and senatorial aspirant Abby Binay emphasized the importance of partnerships with the private sector and good governance in delivering better healthcare and education nationwide. Speaking at the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce & Industry, Inc. (FFCCCII) general assembly, Binay outlined her vision for a Philippines where every citizen benefits from economic growth.


ìImagine a Philippines where every Filipino has access to free healthcare, every child is equipped for success, and job opportunities abound in a thriving economy,î Binay said. She believes that through strategic budget allocations and public-private partnerships (PPPs), Makatiís successful programs can be scaled up for national implementation.
Makatiís experience demonstrates how private sector collaborations can drive transformative progress in healthcare and infrastructure, benefiting residents significantly. ìThese programs are not luxuries; they are necessities that every Filipino deserves,î Binay emphasized. ìThereís no reason why these benefits canít be implemented nationwide, especially for the economically disadvantaged.î
Binay highlighted Makatiís success as proof that transformative programs are both possible and scalable. Initiatives like the Yellow Card, Project FREE, Project FEED, and job generation programs serve as blueprints for national progress. ìThese are achievable goals with the right priorities, partnerships, and shared commitment to progress,î she added.
Good governance is crucial for inclusive progress, ensuring resources are used wisely and decisions prioritize community welfare. Binay attributed Makatiís success to health, education, good governance, and inclusive economic growthódubbing them the ìfour pillars of sustained and people-centered governance.î
In Makati, healthcare is not just a need but a fundamental right. The Yellow Card program provides comprehensive services, including regular checkups, free medicines, dialysis, and chemotherapy. These services alleviate financial burdens, allowing families to focus on well-being.
Education is also a priority. Under Project FREE, students receive free uniforms and supplies, while Project FEED provides nutritious snacks. The city is modernizing education with smart classrooms and prioritizing curriculum improvements and teacher training. ìEducation empowers students to dream bigger, achieve more, and contribute meaningfully to society,î Binay said.
Makati has streamlined business processes to foster a business-friendly environment, ensuring sustainable economic growth. The Makatizen Online Portal enhances efficiency and transparency, making transactions convenient for residents and companies.
ìNone of these achievements would be possible without good governance. Transparency, accountability, and a commitment to serving the people are at the heart of everything we do in Makati,î Binay concluded. ìAs your public servant, I remain committed to ensuring progress uplifts everyone, leaving no one behind.î"

Sa panayam sa kaniya ng Philippine Entertainment Portal (PEP) kamakailan, sinabi raw ni Jimmy na noong una, balak daw sana niyang tumakbo bilang party-list representative, subalit matapos niyang kumonsulta sa mga eksperto, sinabi ng mga ito na mas may pag-asang manalo ang isang celebrity sa senado kasi hindi single vote. Sa political reason daw, iyon daw ang kaniyang dahilan.
Para naman daw sa personal na rason, pakiramdam daw ni Jimmy ay kaya niyang magamit ang karunungan sa batas at koneksyon sa legal community para sa legislative capacity sa Upper House.
Matatandaang bukod sa pagiging singer ay isa nang ganap na abogado si Jimmy matapos makapasa sa Bar noong 2023.
At dahil dito, kung sakali raw na mananalong senador si Jimmy, isa raw sa kaniyang legislative agenda ay ang kapakanan ng music and arts industry. Naniniwala raw siyang mahalaga ito, dahil ang industriya raw ang bumuhay sa mental health ng mundo sa panahon ng pandemya.
Kahit daw may National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) na, a pananaw daw ni Jimmy ay kailangang ihiwalay ang komisyon para sa performing artists.
""Iím hoping in creating budget and the commission,"" paliwanag pa niya sa panayam ng PEP.
Samantala, sa ""Sukatan 2025"" naman ng SMNI noong Linggo, Enero 26, sinabi ni Jimmy na siya ay karapat-dapat iboto dahil siya raw ay ""musika,"" at kagaya raw ng lagi niyang sinasabi sa mga talumpati, ang musika raw ay napakaganda dahil hindi ito makapagsisinungaling. 
""Maaaring magsinungaling ang mga letra ngunit ang himig nito, ang melodiya, ay hindi makakapagtago. Kapag maganda, maganda at kapag hindi, hindi.""
""Ako po ay laging magsasabi sa inyo ng totoo. At ang totoo po ay ito. Hindi po talaga mauubos ang problema ng bayan natin. At kailangan po natin ng diplomasya at disiplina sa senado. Kasi po, noong araw, ang mga problema natin ay ang problema lamang, ngayon ang problema natin mga mambabatas natin, araw-araw nagbabangayan..."" pahayag pa ng senatorial candidate. "

Yung iba, ang burden nila, katulad ko, kaibigan ko si Rodrigo Duterte. Lahat po tayo, we have either an advantage or a cross to bear. So, we must grow where we are planted. At dito po ako nakatanim, I accept all the challenges and the advantages that being a friend of the former president brings.

""Ang akin, gusto ko magbigay ng isang pantay na effort na magpakilala ng totoo. Ayaw ko nga yung word na nanliligaw, hindi rin ako nanliligaw. Ako po ay nagpapakilala. At kung hindi nyo ako iboboto, pagdasal nyo ako. Kasi malay nyo, ang outcome naman ng elections talagang is always by the hand of God. Yun lang naman ang totoo kong paniniwala eh. So we might as well say the truth, stand for the truth, at tingnan natin kung mananaig ang katotohanan,î Bondoc added.
Bondoc said he is running for the Senate to respond to a calling.
""Hindi ako laos dahil hindi naman ako sumikat. Yan ang una. Pangalawa, alam niyo, on a serious note, no? Hindi ko kailangan ipaliwanag kasi sa tao ang calling. Ang calling po, tawag eh, mahirap ipaliwanag. Para sa akin, this is a calling, it is something that I want to do with my life and to be of service to God and to my nation. So, depende na lang sa tao yan kung maniniwala po sila sa akin or hindi. But ako, I do believe it is a true calling,î he said.
ìAlam nyo, yung iba kasi kala nila yung calling parang bigla nalang may kalapating dadapo sa ulo mo. But ako, it was a series of events for a decade. Yung unti-unting pagpasok sa politika, sa serbisyo, unti-unting karunungan, at pag-shift ng career, at nagbabago yung mga minamahal mo at adikain sa buhay. So, yung calling na yun is gradual until you see kung saan ka tinatangay ng Panginoon,î he added.
Bondoc defended his decision to run for the Senate in his first foray into electoral politics.
""Alam mo, una sa lahat, hindi ako naniniwala na may hierarchy sa public positions. Unique yan, eh. May mga tao na mananalo bilang senador, pero hindi mananalo sa party list. Iba kasi yung mga laban dyan, eh. So, syempre, inaral din namin, una, sino ba naman ang gustong matalo?""
""So, inaral namin kung saan yung pinaka may chance na makapagserbisyo tayo. So sa pag-aaral namin, it is here. Pangalawa, gusto ko talaga ang policymaking mula kabataan pa. I like policymaking and making rules work para maging equitable sa mga tao,î Bondoc said."

Jimmy Bondoc, is taking on a new challenge: a Senate seat in this yearís elections.
In an interview with Bilyonaryo News Channelís ìAt The Forefrontî with Atty. Karen Jimeno, Bondoc revealed how his years at PAGCOR opened his eyes to the pressing social issues in the country, which ultimately inspired his bid for public office.
Bondoc, who served as PAGCORís vice president for community relations from 2017 to 2021 and as a board member in 2021, shared that his family ties to the agency initially drew him to its mission.
ìThe first PAGCOR chairperson, Alice Reyes, is my aunt. So very early on, I already understood the social aspect of PAGCORóit wasnít just about gambling,î he said.
When President Rodrigo Duterte took office, Bondoc joined PAGCOR to contribute to what he described as a ìmini-DSWD.î
ìI learned about how Filipinos live and how an agency like PAGCOR can directly change lives,î Bondoc said, noting that the agencyís policies had a transformative impact on communities.
When asked why he decided to seek a Senate seat, Bondoc disclosed that his decision was not made lightly.
ìItís truly a calling,î he said. ìIt wasnít something I realized overnightóit was a series of revelations through prayers.î
Bondoc admitted that the decision to go straight for the Senate, rather than starting at a local position, raised eyebrows.
But he firmly believes that the Senate offers a better platform for enacting change.
ìThe Senate is attractive because itís about lawmaking. I learned in PAGCOR that policies can change lives,î he explained.
He also countered the notion that local or party-list elections are easier to win.
ìIn local politics, youíre up against deeply entrenched patriarchal systemsólike congressmen whoíve been giving houses to their constituents for 30 years. Itís not easy to break through. In the Senate, you just need to present a part of yourself that resonates with a variety of voters. Itís 1 out of 12, and that gives you a better chance,î Bondoc said.
When asked what he can offer to the people, Bondoc sees his outsider status as an advantage.
ìMy best trait as a senator is that Iíve never been a senator. Iím not burdened by the past,î he said.
Drawing from his experience in PAGCOR and his background as a lawyer, Bondoc bared his hands-on approach.
ìIn PAGCOR, especially during relief operations, I personally visited evacuation centers. Iíve traveled the entire country, and Iíve seen the struggles of Filipinos firsthand. I can offer that to the public,î he said.
When asked if his background as an entertainer could be a disadvantage, Bondoc shrugged off the criticism.
ìWe all have a cross to bear but we also have our advantages. Whatever burdens or trials the Lord gives me, I embrace them. People may underestimate me, but I just have to not care,î he said.
Bondocís candid responses and unique journeyófrom the entertainment industry to public serviceóset him apart in a crowded Senate race.
Whether voters will embrace his vision remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: Jimmy Bondoc is ready to bring his experiences, faith, and determination to the forefront of Philippine politics.#"
Bong Revilla,Revilla asks SC anew to stop Sandiganbayan proceedings on plunder raps,22-Mar-18,https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1029610,"MANILA -- Detained former Senator Ramon ìBongî Revilla Jr. filed anew a petition before the Supreme Court (SC) seeking to stop the proceedings at the Sandiganbayan in connection with the PHP224.5-million plunder and graft cases filed against him for alleged misuse of his Priority Development Assistance Fund or pork barrel.
In a seven-page manifestation and urgent motion for interim measures, Revilla reiterated his prayer for the SC to issue or a writ of preliminary injunction or an order restraining further proceedings in his plunder case, particularly those for the reception of his evidence.
He said the Sandiganbayan has compelled him to present evidence for his defense specifically against the 5,134 pieces of evidence it has admitted.
But Revilla said none of the 5,134 pieces of evidence has shown that the basic elements of plunder exists.
ìGiven these injudicious circumstances, petitioner was constrained to give up several trial dates out of the 60 dates allowed by the Sandiganbayan for him to present evidence and he is already in peril of losing all the dates allowed for his defense,î the motion stated dated March 16.
He also asked the tribunal to require the Sandiganbayan to comment and himself to reply to the anti-graft court's pleading.
""Finally, to grant petitioner provisional liberty until the final disposition of the instant petition,"" the motion said.
Revilla said he has been in detention since June 20, 2014 or 1,371 days which violates his right to due process, right to be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved, right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him and right to an impartial trial.
Revilla also asked the SC to set his earlier petition for certiorari in oral arguments.
Last January, Revilla already filed a petition before the Supreme Court accusing the Sandiganbayan of violating his constitutional rights.
Revilla told the SC that while the anti-graft court has denied his motions, it has accepted all the evidence presented by the prosecution even if the evidence, he added, does not point directly to his alleged participation in the pork barrel scam.
The former senator explained that under the law, plunder is supposed to be committed by a series of overt acts but that in the case filed against him, the prosecution failed to present evidence to show the overt acts he committed, except for his endorsement of the non-government organization of Janet Lim Napoles.
This, he stressed, does not identify or show the particular overt acts committed but rather describes an entire process within which those acts are to be found. Still, he said the anti-graft court ignored these, proceeded to dismiss his motions and continued with the trial of his case.
Of the three former lawmakers charged in the pork barrel fund scam, Revilla is the only one left in detention at the PNP Custodial Center in Camp Crame, Quezon City.
Revilla, together with former Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile and former Senator Jinggoy Estrada have been charged with plunder, a non-bailable offense along with alleged brains of the pork barrel scam Janet Lim-Napoles. All three have been detained in 2014.
However, both Enrile and Estrada were able to post bail for their temporary liberty. In 2015, the high court allowed Enrile to post bail for humanitarian reasons while Estrada was allowed by the Sandiganbayan to post bail in 2017.
In August 2015, the SC granted the petition for bail of former senator Juan Ponce Enrile in the same plunder case with Janet Lim Napoles before the Sandiganbayan due to his ""advanced age and poor health.""
The Sandiganbayan special fifth division granted Estrada's plea last September. (PNA)"
Bong Revilla,Revilla acquitted but ordered to 'return' P124 million in public funds,7-Dec-18,https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/12/07/1875049/revilla-acquitted-ordered-return-p124-million-public-funds,"MANILA, Philippines ó The Sandiganbayan acquitted former Sen. Ramon ìBongî Revilla Jr. of plunder over his involvement in the multi-billion pork barrel scam, but it ordered P124.5 million to be returned to the National Treasury.
The Sandiganbayan First Division on Friday handed down a historic rulingóthe first since the pork barrel scam was revealedóon the plunder case against Revilla, his aide Richard Cambe and businesswoman Janet Lim-Napoles, believed to the brains behind the pork barrel scam.
Ombudsman prosecutors said Revilla, through Cambe, allegedly received from businesswoman Janet Lim-Napoles a total of P224.5 million in kickbacks in exchange for the allocation of his Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) to her bogus non-government organizations. The Sandiganbayan in 2015 ordered a freeze of P224 million in assets of Revilla.
In a vote of 3-2, the anti-graft court said that Revilla cannot be held liable for plunder as the prosecution failed to establish ìbeyond reasonable doubtî that the former senator ìreceived, directly or indirectly the rebates, commission and kickbacks from his PDAF.î
The court, however, convicted Cambe and Napoles and sentenced them to reclusion perpetua, or imprisonment of 40 years.
ìIn view of the discussion above, pursuant to Article 100 of the Revised Penal Code, accused are held solidarily and jointly liable to return to the National Treasury the amount of P124.5 million,î the dispositive of Econgís ruling read.
Revilla, Cambe and Napoles are all accused in the case. It is unclear from the decision whether the three would divide the amount among themselves.
Article 100 of the RPC falls under Civil Liability. It provides: ìEvery person criminally liable for a felony is also civilly liable.î
Evidence that is beyond reasonable doubt is required in criminal conviction. In civil cases, a ìpreponderance of the evidenceî or that more convincing evidence is needed.
Part of the Sandiganbayan ruling read: ìThe Court fails to see the hand of Revilla guiding Cambe, Napoles and the JLN staff in the scheme to receive kickbacks or commissions from the PDAF projects.î
Appeal
But Revillaís lawyer, Ramon Esguerra, told reporters that they would contest the order.
ìOn top of my mind right now, if you find somebody not criminally liable, he cannot be civilly liable,î he said.
Esguerra said that Revillaís legal team, which includes seasoned lawyer Estelito Mendoza, are discussing whether they would appeal the case.
ìIf he is not criminally liable, how can e be civilly liable?î he added. ó Video by STAR/Beth Marcelo"
Bong Revilla,All pork barrel scam cases vs Revilla junked,,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1456015/all-pork-cases-vs-revilla-junked,"In a narrow 3-2 vote, the Sandiganbayanís First Division granted the senatorís motion to dismiss the 16 counts of graft against him ó the remaining charges implicating him in the scandal exposed in 2013.
MANILA, Philippines ó The Sandiganbayanís Special First Division, in a narrow 3-2 vote, has acquitted Sen. Ramon ìBongî Revilla Jr. of 16 counts of graft over his alleged involvement in the multibillion-peso pork barrel scam that was exposed in 2013.
The decision clears Revilla of all his remaining criminal cases in connection with the scam. Two years ago, the antigraft court already acquitted Revilla of plunder even as it ordered the senator to return P124 million in public funds, which he has yet to comply with. The 2018 decision was written by Justice Geraldine Econg, who also wrote the decision clearing the senator of the graft charges.
The court granted Revillaís demurrer to evidence ó or motion to dismiss the charges against him, claiming insufficient proof ó but denied the demurrer of the scamís alleged mastermind, Janet Lim Napoles.
Acquitted in a separate resolution by the First Division were former Department of Budget and Management officials Mario Relampagos, Rosario NuÒez, Lalaine Paule, and Marilou Bare, as well as National Livelihood Development Corp. official Chita Jalandoni and National Agribusiness Corp. official Encarnita Munsod.
That resolution cited as a basis Revillaís demurrer as well as the separate demurrers by those accused.
Justices Efren dela Cruz and Bayani Jacinto dissented from the majority vote by Justices Econg, Edgardo Caldona, and Rafael Lagos.
Revillaís latest acquittal comes nearly eight years since the Philippine Daily Inquirer ran a six-part exposÈ on the scam to funnel P10 billion in the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) ó or pork barrel ó of lawmakers to ghost projects in exchange for massive kickbacks for the legislators concerned.
ëValid releasesí
The prosecution sought to establish Revillaís guilt through, among others, the endorsement letters, memorandums of agreement, and project proposals signed by him or his then-chief of staff, Richard Cambe.
The antigraft court, however, concluded that Revillaís requests to endorse and allocate his PDAF to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) owned and controlled by Napoles did not constitute manifest partiality or bad faith.
These requests, the court said, were made before the Supreme Court eventually struck down the PDAF as unconstitutional and were thus considered ìvalid releases of the government.î
ìSo when accused Revilla requested for the release of his PDAF allocation and separately endorsed the NGOs, he was performing acts that were customary at the time,î the court said.It also deemed Revillaís endorsement letters as merely recommendatory, which therefore could not be ìinterpreted as an order to do away with public bidding.î
The court further took note of such phrases in those letters as ìfor appropriate action,î ìas allowed by law,î and ìsubject to government account and auditing rules and regulations.î
ìIt does not command nor compel the implementing agencies to whom these are addressed to award the project to [a] recommended NGO,î the court said.
It added that ìRevillaís endorsement could not be considered to have given unwarranted benefit to the NGOs concerned as it was not within his power to grant or award the project to them.î
ëGlaring absence of evidenceí
The court also noted that apart from Benhur Luy, Napolesí cousin who became the whistleblower in this scandal, ìno other witness or coaccused pointed to conclusive proof that Revilla received money from Napoles or her representatives.î
Luy had testified that he had never personally delivered money to Revilla and that he had never seen the senator receive money from Napoles. Still, he claimed that Revilla made deposits to his bank accounts totaling P20.6 million.
Nevertheless, the ruling concluded that ìthe glaring absence of evidence proving that accused Revilla directly received the proceeds from the PDAF projects or any money from accused Napoles that motivated him to give her and her NGOs unwarranted advantage to the detriment of the government cannot be ignored by the court.î
ìThe continued lack of evidence that would prove beyond reasonable doubt Revillaís involvementÖ leads to a conclusion not different from that reached in the plunder case,î the ruling said further, as it referred to Revillaís plunder acquittal in 2018.
Other accused
Relampagos, NuÒez, Paule, Bare, Jalandoni, and Munsod were accused of approving ìwith undue hasteî the release of Revillaís discretionary funds to the ghost projects without conducting due diligence.
According to Luy, they also received kickbacks, with Napoles allegedly paying for Relampagosí birthday party and giving him and his staff lavish gifts and plane tickets to Hong Kong. However, the court ruled that Luyís bare allegations ìdo not sufficiently establishÖ that the accused received kickbacks representing portions of the PDAF.î
Moreover, it was not proven whether these gifts were given at the same time as the release of the special allotment release orders for the PDAF, the court said.
As for Munsod, whose alleged involvement in the scam was premised on her signatures on at least three disbursement vouchers, the court said the prosecution failed to prove that she acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence, or that she conspired with the rest.
Regarding the 23 checks that Jalandoni issued to Napolesí NGOs, as claimed by the prosecution, the court said that ìother than these checks, there is a dearth of evidence that would link her to the grand design of siphoning money from the government coffers.î
It also supported Jalandoniís argument that she only issued the checks because they already had complete supporting documents.
The court, however, said it was ìclearî that Cambe received kickbacks from the scam."
Bong Revilla,Dissenting Sandigan justices: Bong Revilla canít be innocent,8-Jul-21,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1457151/dissenting-sandigan-justices-bong-revilla-cant-be-innocent,"MANILA, Philippines ó Two justices of the Sandiganbayan strongly disagreed with three others who had cleared Sen. Ramon ìBongî Revilla Jr. of graft in the multibillion-peso pork barrel scam, saying convicted plunderer Janet Napoles could not have siphoned off public funds from the senatorís office without his ìcomplicity.î
In a 3-2 vote, the Special First Division of the antigraft court on Monday announced that it had granted Revillaís motion to dismiss the 16 counts of graft against him for insufficient evidence.
In 2018, Revilla was acquitted of plunder in connection with the P224.5 million that was allegedly funneled from his congressional Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF), or pork barrel, to Napolesí bogus nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).
Despite his plunder acquittal, Revilla faced separate graft charges and was ordered by the court to return P124 million to the state. He refused to return any amount, saying all his money came from legitimate sources, including his income as an actor.
Justices Efren dela Cruz and Bayani Jacinto dissented against the decision of Justices Edgardo Caldona, Rafael Lagos and Geraldine Econg, who authored the resolution clearing Revilla of involvement in the pork barrel scam, which was exposed in 2013. Under the scheme, up to P10 billion from lawmakersí pork barrel had been funneled to ghost projects in exchange for massive kickbacks.
The ruling that acquitted Revilla of plunder, which also was authored by Econg, convicted his coaccused Napoles and Richard Cambe, his chief of staff. Cambe died in prison in April this year.
ëGlaring absenceí
According to the Special Divisionís decision in the graft cases, Revillaís requests to endorse his pork barrel to NGOs owned and controlled by Napoles were ìvalid releases,î ìcustomaryî and ìmerely recommendatoryî and therefore did not constitute ìmanifest partiality or bad faith.î
Article continues after this advertisement
It also said there was a ìglaring absence of evidenceî that the senator profited from the scam, and concluded that his ìliability could no longer be determined Ö as these offenses were already included in the plunder case for which they were already prosecuted.î
But Dela Cruz, in his dissenting opinion, asserted that graft and plunder were ìseparate and distinct from each other.î
Article continues after this advertisement
Citing the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, he said graft was ìnot a predicate act of the crime of plunder and, therefore, not necessarily included in the said crime.î
ìI see no cogent reason why the court could not proceed to try any [of] these cases against accused Revilla,î Dela Cruz said.
Jacinto questioned Revillaís innocence.
ìClearly there was nothing innocent in accused Senator Revilla Jr.ís actions. He was not motivated by public service when he endorsed accused Napolesí NGOs, but prompted by the receipt of kickbacks or commissions that he was to receive from accused Napoles in accordance with their agreement,î Jacinto wrote in his opinion.
NGOs endorsed
He also noted that Revilla endorsed Napolesí NGOs, despite being unqualified, to implement his PDAF projects 11 times.
ìWhile the majority held that there is insufficient evidence to prove accused Senator Revillaís participation and knowledge in the scheme, it confirmed that the accused Napolesí scheme as a whole exists and was operative,î he pointed out.
ìPut simply, her NGOs would have no purpose unless a legislator, in this instance Revilla, gives a go-ahead to start the process, and without whose complicity to raiding the public coffers, the same funds could have been used for the public good,î Jacinto said.
He said it ìrequires a stretch of logicî for the three justices to conclude that Cambe was involved in the scam but not Revilla.
ìTo simply concede that all of the said documents were intercepted by Cambe so that Revilla and the rest of his staff would not be alerted is unreasonable,î he said.
Both Dela Cruz and Jacinto argued that a complex racketeering scheme such as the PDAF scam would have had all the trappings of a legitimate operation and that the majority was amiss in ruling that Revillaís actions were not done in bad faith.
Crimes ëusually secretí
Dela Cruz said the exacting standard of ìproof beyond reasonable doubtî required in conviction did not mean the prosecution could not use circumstantial evidence as ìcrimes are usually committed in secret.î
ìIf direct evidence is insisted on under all circumstances, the prosecution of vicious felons who committed heinous crimes in secret or secluded places will be hard, if not impossible, to prove,î he said.
Commenting on the Sandiganbayanís decision, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque on Tuesday said Revilla was given his day in court, but the prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
ìThat is how the justice system works in the Philippines. The accused are presumed innocent until proven otherwise,î he said.
But this development has no bearing on President Duterte anticorruption drive, Roque pointed out."
Bong Revilla,Prosecutionís 'neglect' to prove Revilla's unexplained wealth was key to his acquittal: lawyer,6-Jul-21,https://www.abs-cbn.com/news/world/2025/5/7/black-smoke-from-sistine-chapel-signals-no-new-pope-0306,"MANILA ó The prosecutionís failure to prove where Senator Ramon ìBongî Revilla, Jr.ís familyís supposed unexplained bank deposits came from was key to his acquittal in the plunder and graft charges against him, his lawyer Ramon Esguerra said Tuesday.
Speaking to ANCís Rundown, Esguerra said the prosecution failed to establish that Revilla received kickbacks from the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF), despite the report from the Anti-Money Laundering Council showing P87 million in deposits entering his familyís bank accounts from 2006 to 2010.
The deposits supposedly fell on dates within 30 days from dates mentioned in whistleblower Benhur Luyís ledger when Revilla, through his aide Richard Cambe, allegedly received commissions or rebates to his PDAF in cash.
ì[T]he AMLC report is rather short ó meaning ó it did not serve its purpose. It only listed what you call deposits made over time, and they made the conclusion that the deposits were made at about the same time that there were transactions involving PDAF. They made a 'one plus one', 'ok, this is it, this is the booty'Ö the product of their conspiracy,î he said.
ìBut they could have gone more. Where is the SALN? Will those amounts in the report of AMLC correspond to the SALN that had been filed by the senator and even by the wife, who was also a government official? Thatís the issue. And they did not do so. What I am saying [is], they fell short of really closing that particular issue of fact in the trial of the case,î he added.
Revilla was accused of conspiring with his now-deceased aide Cambe, and pork barrel scam queen Janet Lim Napoles, in diverting millions in PDAF to the latter's bogus non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in exchange supposedly for a 50 percent kickback from the projects.
He was acquitted in December 2018 after the Sandiganbayan First Division found no single direct evidence to establish he received the rebate, commission or kickback from his PDAF projects, and that circumstantial evidence were not enough to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
In a resolution dated July 1 but released Monday, the Sandiganbayan Special First Division also junked 16 counts of graft charges against Revilla by granting his demurrer to evidence, essentially a motion to dismiss based on insufficiency of evidence presented by the prosecution.
The ruling was penned by Justice Geraldine Faith Econg, concurred in by Justices Rafael Lagos and Edgardo Caldona, while Justices Efren dela Cruz and Bayani Jacinto dissented.
In his dissent, Dela Cruz said there were sufficient evidence to convict Revilla, just as he had said in his dissent to the ruling junking the plunder charge against the senator.
Dela Cruz cited the AMLC report, which also showed that a company controlled by Revillaís wife, Lani Mercado, recorded deposits of about P28 million even when it was not operating and later received a deposit of P16 million from the Revilla couple.
He also said Revilla himself admitted and confirmed to the Commission on Audit the signatures in some 68 documents.
Revilla was acquitted of plunder due to variance in his supposed signatures, based on the Sandiganbayan justicesí own physical examination of the senatorís alleged signatures.
In addition, Dela Cruz said it was against human nature for Revilla to continue employing Cambe even if the latter did not turn over to him his rebates/commission amounting to hundreds of millions of pesos.
ìA criminal scheme so complex in nature, such as in these cases, would reveal that the accused carefully orchestrated the same that evidently, no direct proof linking some of them to the crime scene will be available. However, this does not impede this Court to ascertain the involvement of the accused through circumstantial evidence,î he said.
But Esguerra rejected Dela Cruzís view.
ìThe confirmation simply says ëthey appear,í he did not say they are my signatures. ëThey appear.í You know, youíre talking here of so many endorsements. So we do not want to go into detail of which endorsements were confirmed by the senator as they appear to be my signature. But he did not say they are my signatures. Thatís two different things,î he told ANC regarding supposed signatures of Revilla in some documents.
Esguerra also stressed the Revillas were under no obligation to explain their wealth.
ìThey are not bound. Remember that at the point that the good senator filed his demurrer to evidence, the prosecution has just rested. And that is the basis really of demurrer to evidence - that the evidence is insufficient to have him convicted of the charges under RA 3019. And you remember the burden, the burden of proving that one is guilty beyond reasonable doubt, is upon the prosecution,î he said.
ìSo thatís where, as I said, the prosecution fell short. They should have put in additional evidence to show that this income or incomes reported, deposits made in the banks could not have been sourced from their ordinary or regular sources of income, their salaries, allowances, from being public officials or from their businesses. But nothing. Thatís where the prosecution stopped eh. The prosecution, after presenting the AMLC report, thatís it. They should have gone further,î he explained.
Esguerra faulted the prosecution for the fate of the graft and plunder charges against Revilla.
ìIt was not really a blunder. But it was, to me, a neglect on the part of the prosecution to close that particular piece of evidence. There is no conclusion that you can derive from it other than, 'ok, there were deposits made or found', but what are they? Are they the very kickbacks that Mr. Revilla or the senator received from Napoles? Walang dikit. Hindi naidikit. Thatís my point there,î he said.
Aside from the failure to prove that Revilla received kickbacks, the anti-graft court also held that Revillaís endorsements of PDAF funds to NGOs were merely recommendatory and that he could no longer be separately charged with graft since the same acts were the bases for the plunder charge against him.
The same court upheld the graft charges against Napoles while it dropped the case against Cambe due to his death in April this year.
Before he died, Cambe was able to issue a statement, through his lawyer, in January this year, which Dela Cruz quoted in his dissent.
ìWhat am I, alone in the jail right now? I donít have money, even the AMLC doesnít have ó(paused)óno evidence that I have ill-gotten wealth, that I have accumulated ill-gotten wealth during my stay in the government. I donít have ill-gotten wealth, Your Honors. I donít have money. I even gave my statement of assets and liabilities for them to investigate, but no, they are not interested,î he wrote.
Cambe, who was convicted for supposedly amassing P224 million in kickbacks from the pork barrel scam, died of stroke in a public hospital while serving his sentence at the New Bilibid Prison."
Bong Revilla,From arrest to acquittal: Bong Revilla's 'pork barrel' case,7-Dec-18,https://www.abs-cbn.com/news/nation/2025/5/7/2-chinese-arrested-over-kidnapping-of-3-foreigners-in-batangas-1648,"MANILA - (UPDATE) Movie actor and former senator Ramon ""Bong"" Revilla Jr was acquitted of plunder Friday after languishing in detention for 4 years.
Revilla was accused of pocketing P224 million in kickbacks from fake projects with the help of businesswoman Janet Lim Napoles, who was convicted of plunder during a promulgation of their case on Friday.
Here is a timeline of Revilla's case:
AUGUST 16, 2013
Then senators Revilla, Juan Ponce Enrile, and Jinggoy Estrada were tagged in a special report by the Commission on Audit as among those who allegedly endorsed part of their discretionary funds to bogus non-government organizations linked to Napoles.
AUGUST 29, 2013
At the start of the Senate investigation into alleged ""pork barrel"" misuse, former COA Chair Ma. Gracia Pulido-Tan said Enrile, Estrada, and Revilla funneled part of their pork barrel funds to fake NGOs linked to Napoles.
SEPTEMBER 12, 2013
PDAF scam whistle-blower Benhur Luy claimed he transacted with the offices of Enrile, Revilla, and Estrada for Napoles. He also revealed that Revilla, hidden under the moniker ""Pogi,"" received the biggest kickback at P224 million.
SEPTEMBER 16, 2013
The Department of Justice files plunder charges against the 3 senators, Napoles and several others in connection with the pork barrel scam before the Office of the Ombudsman.
MAY 15, 2014
A list of government officials that Napoles claims she had transacted with was released by the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee. It included Revilla.
JUNE 6, 2014
The Ombudsman files plunder and graft charges against Enrile, Estrada, Revilla and several others before the Sandiganbayan.
JUNE 20, 2014
Two hours after the Sandiganbayan issues an arrest warrant against Revilla, the former action star surrendered to authorities at the anti-graft court.
He was detained at the Police Custodial Center in Camp Crame on the same day. Estrada was arrested 3 days later while Enrile joined them a month later.
Since their arrest in 2014, only Revilla remained in detention after Enrile was allowed to post bail in 2015 on humanitarian grounds while Estrada posted bail in September 2017.

The Sandiganbayan starts the P224-million plunder trial of Revilla, making him the first legislator to be tried over the P10-billion ""pork barrel"" scam.
JULY 27, 2017
Revilla claimed during the third day of his pluder trial that he was as much a victim in the PDAF scam as the witnesses who testified against him.
""I have nothing to do with this. Alam nating biktima sila. Biktima rin ako [We all know they were victims. I'm a victim too],"" Revilla said in a media interview after the hearing.
JUNE 28, 2018
Revilla denied before the anti-graft court that he received kickbacks from Napoles.
""I never received money from Janet Lim Napoles at sa mga kasamahan niya (and her colleagues),"" Revilla said.
Whistleblowers Marina Sula, Mary Arlene Baltazar and Merlina SuÒas apparently sided with Revilla as they claimed that they did not see the former lawmaker sign the supposed endorsement letters for PDAF projects.
The 3 prosecution witnesses instead claimed that it was actually their fellow whistleblower, Benhur Luy, who signed some of the documents.
AUGUST 9, 2018
The Sandiganbayan ends the plunder trial.
DECEMBER 7, 2018
Revilla was cleared of plunder and was released from detention on the same day.
The court's decision marks the first resolution of a PDAF scam case since the Ombudsman began filing charges in 2014. Revilla however is still facing graft charges."
Bong Revilla,Ombudsman will not appeal Senator Revillaís acquittal of 16 PDAF graft charges,8-Jul-21,https://www.ombudsman.gov.ph/ombudsman-will-not-appeal-senator-revillas-acquittal-of-16-pdaf-graft-charges/,"The Office of the Ombudsman has rested its case against Senator Ramon ìBongî Revilla Jr.   This after the Sandiganbayan (SB) acquitted him for insufficiency of evidence on the remaining 16 graft cases in relation to the pork barrel scam.  The SB First Division voted 3-2 to grant Senator Revillaís Demurrer to Evidence, AND WE RESPECT ITS DECISION.
Consistent with the defendantís constitutional right against double jeopardy, Ombudsman Samuel Martires sets the policy of no longer challenging the dismissal of cases/quashal of information and judgments of acquittal, either through a motion to dismiss, a demurrer to evidence or by a decision, rendered by the trial courts or the Sandiganbayan except when the People was clearly deprived of due process or there was mistrial.
In 2014, Senator Revilla was accused of diverting his Priority Development Assistance Fund for the years 2006 to 2009 to non-governmental organizations linked to Janet Napoles, and getting P224.5M kickback in the process.
A demurrer to evidence is a motion to dismiss on the ground of insufficiency of evidence.  The grant of the court of the demurrer is tantamount to an acquittal because the defendant is cleared of the criminal case and is no longer required to present his evidence"

The Metropolitan Manila Development (MMDA) official seeks legal action against retired Colonel Bonifacio Bosita for interfering traffic enforcers.
The MMDA Chief Edison Bong Nebrija took Facebook to lambast retired Col. Bonifacio Laqui Bosita for allegedly interfering with enforcers. Bosita, the founder of Riders íSafety Advocates of the Philippines, is known for helping riders who are caught by enforcers.

But MMDA traffic operations chief did not like Bositaís alleged interference in the enforcerís work. According to Nebrija, Bosita has no right to interfere in the enforcers decision.
ìIlabas mo ang batas na nagtatalaga sayo ng kapangyarihan na pagbayarin ang enforcer namin ang isang araw na sweldo ng hinuli nila, baka usurpation of authority ka boy para iutos at ipilit sa enforcer namin yan.î Nebrija said.
In his statement, Nebrija accused Bosita of using his assistance to riders to enter politics. Nebrija also mentioned a case where the enforcer asked Bosita not to post him on the internet, but the retired police officer still posted on social media.

Although Nebrija did not mention Bositaís name, many netizens said that the retired policeman is being branded by the MMDA officer because he is already well-known on social media.

Bosita now has 279,000 followers on his Youtube page and some of his videos have also reached millions of views. Bosita, just like the veteran journalist Raffy Tulfo, helps motorcycle riders who encounter bad service and inaccurate apprehension of traffic enforcers."

Bonifacio Bosita,Parang away kapitbahay': Bosita on diplomacy in resolving West PH Sea dispute,14-Apr-25,https://www.newswatchplus.ph/news/2025/4/14/bonifacio-bosita-on-west-ph-sea.html,"Metro Manila, Philippines - Conflicts in the West Philippine Sea should be resolved through diplomatic means, said senatorial candidate and retired police officer Bonifacio Bosita.
Bosita expressed his views on the country asserting its rights in the contested area during the ìAng Kandidato: A NewsWatch Plus election roundtable.î
ìPara mas madaling maintindihan ng ating mga kababayan iyong opinyon ni Col. Bosita, parang away lang din lang iyan ng kapitbahay. I-maintain mo na lang iyong pag-aari mo at huwag kang magpakita ng intensyon na parang nagpo-provoke ka,î he said.
[Translation: To make it easier for our fellow countrymen to understand Col. Bosita's opinion, it's like just a neighborly quarrel. Just maintain your property and don't show any intention that might seem like you're provoking.]
He said third party interference is unnecessary to prevent regional tensions from further rising.
The Philippines has an existing visiting forces agreement (VFA) with the United States and Australia and a reciprocal access agreement with Japan. The government has also concluded negotiations for a VFA status with Canada and New Zealand and is set to sign a key defense deal with Germany in May.
ìWalang ibang hihigit pa. Huwag tayo ipokrito. Gusto ba natin ng giyera? Wala naman tayo kakayahang makipag-away sa China. So best pa rin diplomatic approach at huwag tayo magpasakop. Huwag natin hayaan na may nakiki-aalam at parang ito pa ang naglilikha na ito pa ang nagtataas ng tensyon between China and Philippines,î Bosita said.
[Translation: Nothing is more important than this. Letís not be hypocrites. Do we want war? We donít have the capability to fight China. So the best approach is still diplomatic, and we shouldnít allow ourselves to be subjugated. Letís not allow others to interfere, as it seems they are the ones escalating the tension between China and the Philippines.]
President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. earlier ruled out going to war with China and pushed for a peaceful resolution to the territorial row. In 2024, the Marcos administration has agreed to a provisional deal for resupply and rotation missions to the Ayungin Shoal amid aggressions from Beijing.

Bonifacio Bosita,"Bosita, Querubin team up for Senate race in 2025 midterm polls",17-Feb-25,https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2025/02/17/2422183/bosita-querubin-team-senate-race-2025-midterm-polls,"MANILA, Philippines ó Two senatorial candidates have joined forces in their bid for the 2025 midterm elections.
Rep. Bonifacio Bosita (1-Rider Partylist) and retired colonel Ariel Querubin announced their alliance on February 14, branding themselves the ìriding-in-tandemî team, should they secure Senate seats.
Bosita, a former police officer, entered politics ahead of the 2022 national and local elections under the 1-Rider Partylist. 
Formed in 2021, the party made its debut in the race for a House seat, coinciding with Bositaís founding of Ridersí Safety Advocates of the Philippines (RSAP), which later partnered with 1-Rider.
The 1-Rider Partylist, which seeks to champion the rights of motorists and advocates for road safety, secured two House seats after garnering the second-highest number of votes in the elections. 
Bosita drew public attention before the 2022 elections after confronting a traffic enforcer who had ticketed a couple on a motorcycle for violating the shoes-only policy in 2021.
In February 2022, he was arrested in Surigao del Sur on charges of grave coercion and usurpation of authority, accused of leveraging traffic enforcers for political gain, but posted bail afterward.
Meanwhile, his campaign partner, Querubin, had a wide military background. A former member of the Philippine Marine Corps, he participated in the 2017 Battle of Marawi and took part in military operations against communist rebels and insurgents.
He was previously affiliated with the Brotherhood of Christian Businessmen and Professionals, whose members supported former Vice President Leni Robredoís 2022 presidential bid. 
Due to this alignment, Querubin resigned from the group in April 2022, accusing Robredo of having ties to the communist movement, despite her statement that she would not form alliances with organizations that use violence.
However, the retired colonel was among those who visited Robredoís Angat Buhay office in Naga City, Camarines Sur, in October 2024 ó just weeks after the filing of his certificate of candidacy for senator.  
Before the 2022 elections, Querubin was also among those involved in a 2006 coup plot against former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo at Fort Bonifacio.
After receiving amnesty from the late President Benigno Aquino III in 2010, Querubin ran for a Senate seat under the Nacionalista Party alongside President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in that year's elections but was unsuccessful. 
The 2025 midterm elections will mark Querubin's second bid for a Senate seat, while it will be Bositaís first.
Only 12 Senate seats are up for grabs, with around 66 aspirants initially vying for a spot. However, this number has decreased as several candidates, including Willie Ong, Chavit Singson and Rep. Wilbert Lee (Agri Partylist), have since withdrawn their bids."
Arlene Brosas,Rep. Arlene D. Brosas: An activist in the halls of power,6-Mar-24,https://up.edu.ph/rep-arlene-d-brosas-an-activist-in-the-halls-of-power/,"The life of an activist can be challenging enough as it is. But for an activist in the halls of power, dealing directly with both the communities you serve on one hand and with the hostile members of the opposition themselves on the other, juggling conflicting needs and interests while still continuing to do the right thing, the challenge can be on a whole other level.
Rep. Arlene D. Brosas, member of the Philippine House of Representatives for the Gabriela Womenís Party-list group since 2016, knows how tough it can be for an activist working inside the systemóspecifically, the lower house of Congress. This UP alumna, former UP faculty member, and child rights and womenís rights activist sat down with the UP Forum to talk about some of her experiences as an activist in the Philippine legislature.
 
Q. To set the groundwork, we have to ask: How do you define activism, and what differentiates activism from public service?
 
Sa tingin ko mas general ang activism. Both the public and private sector can engage in it. Pero ang public service, may position ka in the public sector. Nasa barangay ka, o nasa level ka ng munisipyo, o nasa level ka ng city hallóhanggang sa Congress, hanggang sa Senate, public service yan. Kahit naman yung ginagawa ng gobyerno, dapat buong-buo. Public service ëyon.
I think the distinction is in the coverage or scope. Doon magkakatalo kasi malawak ang aktibismo per se. Private individuals and the general public can be activists, each according to their own causes and beliefs. Not only in terms of ideologies, but in all spheresóthe environment, political issues, and so onóthere is activism.
 
Q. Youíve been in Congress for seven years and this is your last termó
 
Tapos na ako! Nakakapagod, eh! [Laughter]
Grabe talaga ang ginagawa ko. Tumambling talaga ako sa loob ng Kongreso. Sometimes you have positions that really collide with the majority of them. Itís really about the principles; labanan ng prinsipyo sa buhay sa loob ng Congress. And itís even more difficult when you donít come from their ranks. Like meóespecially me, coming from the ranks of the ordinary people.
But of course, kaya naman kami tumatagal diyan, lalo na sa Makabayan bloc (Makabayang Koalisyon ng Mamamayan): itís because we serve the people. We always abide by our principle: na paglingkuran ang mamamayan na walang interes ng iilan kung hindi para sa majority.
 
Q. What has it been like for you, being an activist in the halls of the legislature?
 
Itís been very difficult for me. Syempre, nanggaling ako sa mahirap talaga. And then coming from a non-government organization and from the teaching sectoróhindi talaga nag-jive dito sa Congress.
Pero bakit kami tumatagal? Because we see that, in all spheres, kailangan yung mga katulad natin. The so-called activists. Yung mga iba mag-isip. We need this in a democracy; it wouldnít be a real democracy without it. Kailangang may mga ibang tinig na naririnig; in fact, dapat nga mas marami yung tinig ng mga majority na naririnig. Ako, sa tingin ko, ang composition natin sa Kongreso ay dapat mga magsasaka, mangingisda, manggagawa, kasi ëyun naman ang marami sa atin. But this is not the case. Mahirap kasi kapag nasa powerful class ka. Iba yung yung lente mo. You may favor the big businesses; may mga ties pa nga yung iba. May problema talaga sa ganoín, di ba?
Sa amin, madali para sa amin ang magsalita. We can name names because weíre not connected to any interests. Kaya naming pag-usapan yung mga mining companies na pumapasok, halimbawa. Yung mga kailangang ikundena. The activities we should be indignant about.
 
Q. The pluses and minuses of not being in the majority in Congress.
 
Even in governance, we have not been getting any pork barrel. Yung medical assistance, which is given to all, sabi namin dapat hindi dumaan sa mga Kongresista kung hindi dapat i-diretso sa ospital kasi dapat wala tayong tinatanggihang pasyente. Kung gusto mo talaga na asikasuhin ang universal healthcare, di dapat universal siya, dapat lahat ng mga nangangailangan, naaasikaso. Pero hindi ganon, eh. Sa BARMM (Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao), ang dami-daming kawawang mga mamamayan, tapos sasabihin na napakalaki ng budget ng gobyerno, pero hindi ito allotted para sa mga nangangailangan.
We study all of that. Yung activism namin, doon yung point niyaóthe different voices. The voices that are not usually heard within the halls of the power. Dito, sa tingin ko hindi naman kami second-class citizens, kasi matatapang kami.
Pero kakaunti lang kami. Weíre just a minority among the 300+ na kasama namin na iba ang itotono o susunod lang sa kung ano ang sasabihin ng mga nasa poder. Kami, yung critical voices, ay limited sa loob ng Kongreso, kaya napakahirap ng sitwasyon.
Pero ang sabi nga namin, hanggaít hindi nagbabago yung sistema, hindi rin kami magbabago. Hindi kami mga national heroes, at hindi rin ëyon namin ginusto na mapunta sa pag-frame nang ganoín. But the situation calls for it. Until such a time that the people will realize that we need radical change, and that radical change is in their hands. Nasa taumbayan ëyan eh. At hindi tanga ang mga tao. It is because the problems are systemic, and the root causes of all these problems in our nation have not been resolved. Yung kahirapan, kailangan nating tugunan ito kasi kung natutugunan ito, maganda-ganda na sana yung disposisyon natin. Mas marami-rami sana ang representasyon ng katulad namin. But apparently, this is not the case. May gusto ang status quo na ganito, so ganito talaga ang nangyayari hanggaít walang pagkilos para sa pagbabago.

Q. What does an average day in Congress look like for you?
 
Oh my God! Tatlo, apat, lima na gawain sa isang buong araw. This includes yung paglabas mo, kasi syempre, you donít explain the issues here. Hindi ka naman makakakuha ng simpatya dito, kasi buo na ang mga desisyon dito. So what do you do? Pupunta ka sa baba. Makikipag-usap ka talaga sa mga communities and organizations na nangangailangang malaman ang mga ito.
So most of the time, nasa labas kami. Pero kapag may mga pukpukang laban sa usapin ng mga pinapasang batas na tax reform na hindi naman nakakatulongódagdag tax lang sa taumbayan itoóat mga usapin pa ng national budget, confidential funds, at iba pa, kailangan talaga namin ëyon tutukan. At madugo ito. For example, committee hearings usually start at 9:00 AM here. Marami ëyan: Public Order, Justice, etc.
So, sometimes, I have to choose kung aling committee yung may mga tina-tackle na matitindi. Hanggaít kaya, gagawan ko ng paraan na mapuntahan lahat, pero hindi nga ëyon posible minsan. So I have to choose one, two, or three that I need to focus on. Primarily, ito yung, at least, mga may pusisyon yung ating mga mangingisda, manggagawa, magsasaka, ganon. Then I go on to the 3 PM Plenary. Sa Plenary ita-tackle ang mga bills at legislations. So kapag meron nang mga naka-tackle doon na for interpellation or Plenary debates, ëyun yung kailangan naming unahin, pag-aralan, etc. Since we are not in the majority, hindi namin agad-agad nalalaman ëyon.
Then you end the day sometimes at 8 PM, 9 PM, 12 AM, depending on the time allotted for the Plenary. Pagka-budget na ang pinag-uusapan, mas malala pa dyan. Mga isang buwan halos na Committee hearings, at walang tulugan ëyun kasi bawat ahensya kailangan namin himayin. Doon lumuluwa yung mata ko.
So talagang mahirap para sa amin. Trabaho talaga. Kaya kailangan mo rin ng matibay na legislative staff. Kailangan namin paghati-hatian ang trabaho.
Fortunately, sa amin sa Makabayan, as a collective namin pinag-uusapan ang mga bagay-bagay so we donít decide na anu-ano na lang. We consult one another. Meron na kami kaagad na positions sa bawat isyu, depende sa isyu. Minsan may nagkakamali. Minsan hindi namin naaasikaso yung mga ilang mga bagay, pero tinitiyak talaga namin naólalo na sa mga pinaka-general isyuónapag-usapan namin. We make sure our decision-making is consultative.
Pero yun nga. We need more people [in Congress] who will speak up for others. Kasi, syempre, ang gusto lang ng majority ay yung status quo, kaya hindi talaga ire-resolve ang education problem, ang health problem. But the young ones, ang mga kabataan natin na bago at mabilis mag-isipókailangan natin ëyon. We need more youth involved in all aspects.
Q. What are some of the challenges activists in governance face?
 
Itís very dangerous for us. Ganoín yung nangyayari sa amin, nire-redtag kami. Madalas ang sasabihin sa iyo, ìNPA ka kasi!î Lalo na noong panahon ng Duterte administration, ginawa nilang norm na patayin yung mga aktibistaóite-terror-tag ka para ma-isolate ka, gagawan ka ng kung anu-anong intriga para hindi ka makapagsalita. Kaya parang nile-legitimize nila na sampahan kami ng gawa-gawang kaso tapos sasaktan kami o gagawan kami ng masama. And they make it seem that itís okay. This is the narrative they try to push, kasi hindi masagot yung mga tanong namin. Hindi kami ma-engage sa aktual na mg isyu. Kaya ganoín ang ginagawa.
I have experienced surveillance. Ni-rally na ako sa mga lugar kung saan sasabihin na ganoín kami. Naranasan ko na rin yung sinusundan ako sa highway, yung nakikita mong naka-motorsiklo sila. Kakabahan ka talaga kasi parang ano? Papatayin ka ba?
Yung pamilya ko, takot din sila, pero wala naman silang magagawa because this is my choice. Sabi ko sa kanila, kahit na anong mangyari, kahit ikamatay ko ito, mas gugustuhin ko na may ginawa ako para sa pagbabago.
 
Q. As a graduate of UP, how did your UP education in shaping your career, character, and life decisions?
 
Malaking bagay ito sa akin. Yung resilience koótingin ko, galing talaga ëyon sa survival ko sa education sa UP. Kaya yung appreciation ko sa UP education koógrabe, sobra! Ito yung humubog sa akin. Iba mag-isip sa UP, eh. Napaka-liberal, napaka-democratic. And the academe should be just that. Hindi siya dapat hinahaluan ng kung anu-ano, at hindi dapat siya pinapasista.
At para sa mga susunod na henerasyon: Papayag ba kayo na hindi nagsasalita ang mga tao? Yung mga susunod na kabataan: Ano na? Susunod lang, hindi mag-iisip? Ang hirap noon, lalo na sa ating mga taga-UP. Hindi madali para sa atin tanggapin na nakakahon ka sa ganito na lang.
Kasi, di ba? Iba kami!"
Arlene Brosas,Gabriela Womenís Party welcomes DQ bid vs. misogynist candidate,18-Apr-25,https://kodao.org/gabriela-womens-party-welcomes-dq-bid-vs-misogynist-candidate/,"News
The countryís womenís party welcomed the disqualification petition against a sexist congressional candidate it said refuses to sincerely apologize to those he offended on at least two public occasions.
Gabriela Womenís Party (GWP) said the Commission on Elections (Comelec) has finally responded to the clamor of women, especially solo parents, gravely offended by Pasig congressional candidate Christian ìIanî Sia Atty.
ìInstead of issuing a sincere apology, Sia showed no remorse and even doubled down, hiding behind ëfreedom of speechí in a desperate attempt to brush off the serious harm caused by his remarks,î said Gabriela Partylist Representative and senatorial candidate Arlene Brosas.
Sia said in a campaign sortie that lonely single mothers who are still menstruating may sleep with him, earning him condemnations from various groups, including GWP.
When Sia tried defending himself, he asked a female assistant to come onstage and referred to her figure to show he does not discriminate against women, earning more condemnations.
When told to explain by the poll body why he should not be disqualified, Sia claimed freedom of speech as justification, leading to the Comelec Task Force Safeguarding Against Fear and Exclusion (SAFE) to file the disqualification petition.
The petition said Sia violated Comelec Resolution 11116 ñ Anti-Discrimination and Fair Campaigning Guidelines ñ that may lead to his disqualification from the May 12 elections or his prevention from being proclaimed winner.
Brosas commended the Comelec for its ìdecisive action,î adding the move must set a precedent against ìabusive, demeaning, and discriminatory rhetoric against women during the campaign period.î
Meanwhile, Gabriela Womenís Party First Nominee Sarah Elago said they expect more cases to follow against other candidates who have likewise made sexist and misogynistic statements.
ìOther candidates who disrespect women must be held to the same standard. Let this serve as a clear warning that sexism has no place in public office,î Elago said. # (Raymund B. Villanueva)"
Arlene Brosas,Gabriela to Pasig congressional bet: ëKabastusan is not freedom of speechí,12-Apr-25,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mr4lhIgHSxG9v6XV6eQim5Y5HMRdTqKmjPaKh51XnnU/edit?tab=t.vuv85hjs9t4u,"Gabriela Rep. Arlene Brosas condemned Pasig City congressional candidate Christian Sia for invoking freedom of speech in defending his remarks about single mothers.
Brosas said Siaís unapologetic defense of his discriminatory remarks against single mothers is a ìblatant display of misogyny that has no place in Philippine politics.î
ìSiaís arrogant invocation of ëfreedom of speechí to justify his demeaning statements against single mothers is precisely why we need stronger measures against sexism and misogyny in our electoral process,î Brosas said.
ìHindi yan ëfreedom of speechí, kabastusan yan sa kababaihan, lalo na sa mga solo parents na nagtataguyod ng kanilang pamilya,î she added.
Brosas stressed that freedom of speech has limitations, especially when it perpetuates discrimination and harm against marginalized sectors.
ìLet us be clear: freedom of speech does not protect hate speech or discriminatory remarks that demean and marginalize women,î Brosas explained.
ìWhen a candidate for public office makes statements that reinforce harmful stereotypes against women, it is not merely an exercise of free speechóit is an abuse of privilege and power that undermines womenís equal participation in society and politics,î she asserted.
Gabriela party-listís first nominee Sarah Elago said that Siaís refusal to apologize and his insistence that his remarks did not discriminate against women only reinforces the urgency of passing the ìBawal Bastos sa Eleksyon Billî (House Bill 11498).
HB 11498 seeks to make misogynistic and discriminatory remarks grounds for disqualification of candidates in local and national elections.
ìThis only proves that there is a deep-seated culture of misogyny among some politicians who believe they can demean women without consequences,î Elago said.
ìSolo parents deserve our respect and support, not ridicule from those seeking public office. Ang mga kandidatong nagpapakita ng ganitong pag-uugali ay hindi karapat-dapat maglingkod sa taumbayan,î she added.
Elago stressed that candidates who hide behind freedom of speech to perpetuate harmful stereotypes against women should not be tolerated."

Philippine divorce activists vow to fight on
Agence France-Presse
Published on: 
11 Feb 2025, 12:10
In her bid to convince lawmakers to legalize divorce, Filipina fruit vendor Avelina Anuran has publicly testified about the abuse she said she regularly endured at the hands of her husband. 

She also keeps a copy of the medical certificate from the bloody injuries she says he inflicted, hoping it might one day serve as evidence in court.

But the mother of two-turned-activist has gotten no closer to ending her marriage. 

The Philippines is one of just two countries ó along with Vatican City ó where divorce remains illegal. 

Last week, the latest attempt to introduce a divorce law evaporated as the upper house ended its session without even a hearing.

""They kept passing it around,"" Anuran said.

The last time such legislation made its way to the Senate in 2019, she painstakingly detailed her experience for a public hearing. But the bill foundered.

Spouses have a ""right to be free"", she told AFP, adding that she would keep pushing for a law.

""Hopefully it will (pass) next year, with new senators coming in.""

Nullification
Ending a marriage in the deeply Catholic society of 117 million is possible only via annulment or ""nullification"". 

But few Filipinos can afford the fee of up to $10,000, and the process does not consider domestic violence, abandonment or infidelity as qualifying grounds.

""I just want to be free from this marriage,"" said Anuran, whose estranged husband remains the beneficiary on a life insurance policy she cannot change without his consent.

Campaigners like Anuran believe the tide of public support for divorce is turning, with surveys showing about half of Filipinos now firmly back a change.

Before taking office in 2022, President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. said he was open to supporting divorce.

But the latest effort to introduce such a bill still faced strong opposition in the Senate.

The proposed law would have compelled courts to provide free legal and psychological assistance to low-income petitioners, capped lawyers' fees at P50,000 ($859) and mandated divorce petitions be resolved within a year.

The divorce bill's co-author, lawmaker Arlene Brosas, said it was ""unacceptable"" that the Senate had refused to tackle the measure given the ""strong public demand"".

She said her Gabriela Women's Party will refile it when a newly elected Congress convenes in July.

""We will continue fighting for the divorce bill, no matter the composition of the Senate and House of Representatives in the next term,"" Brosas told AFP.

'Afraid of backlash'
The previous bill was likely influenced by the mid-term elections in May, family lawyer Lorna Kapunan told AFP.

""Because (half of senators) are seeking re-election, they are afraid of the backlash of the Catholic Church,"" Kapunan said.

Senate President Francis Escudero had argued the bill would ""create divisiveness,"" suggesting instead that the grounds for nullification could be expanded while avoiding the word ""divorce"".

Father Jerome Secillano of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines, meanwhile said divorce contravenes the Church's teachings on marriage and would ultimately destroy families.

""We will see more couples separating. We will see children who don't know where to go,"" Secillano told AFP. 

He also argued the number of domestic abuse victims would ""double"" as divorced men would ""have another chance to be violent again"" to new spouses.

Kapunan called the existing laws ""very complicated, very expensive, very anti-woman and anti-child"". 

Despite the opposition and failed previous attempts to legalize divorce, Anuran remains determined.

""No one's backing down. Win or lose, the fight will continue.""

Arlene Brosas,"Stop crackdown vs NGOs, cops urged",29-Jan-25,https://www.philstar.com/nation/2025/01/29/2417612/stop-crackdown-vs-ngos-cops-urged,"MANILA, Philippines ó House Assistant Minority Leader and Gabriela Womenís party-list Rep. Arlene Brosas is urging authorities to stop the crackdown on non-government organizations (NGOs) suspected of having links to communists.
Brosas made the call following the dismissal of a complaint of terrorism financing filed by the police Criminal Investigation and Detection Group against the Leyte Center for Development Inc. (LCDE), a non-government organization serving victims of Super Typhoon Yolanda.
She described the dismissal of the complaint as a victory against malicious red-tagging of humanitarian organizations and its members.
ìThe dismissal of this baseless case proves what we have been saying all along, that these terrorism financing charges are nothing but desperate attempts to harass and intimidate humanitarian organizations and development workers who serve our most vulnerable communities,î Brosas said in a statement issued yesterday.
Brosas said the dismissal showed how the anti-terror law is being weaponized against legitimate organizations.
Last year, the Makabayan bloc filed House Resolution 1985 seeking to investigate what it described as the systematic judicial harassment against NGOs and human rights defenders, which included the case of the LCDE and other development organizations.
Brosas said the state must stop accusing and persecuting development workers and humanitarian organizations that provide assistance to communities that have no access to government services."
Arlene Brosas,Bill seeking to disqualify misogynist candidates filed in House,8-Apr-25,https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1247715,"MANILA ñ A party-list lawmaker on Tuesday filed a bill seeking to disqualify local and national candidates who make misogynistic or discriminatory remarks during election campaigns.
Gabriela Rep. Arlene Brosas filed at the House of Representatives Bill 11498, which proposes amendments to Sections 68 and 261 of the Omnibus Election Code.
The bill seeks to make misogynistic and gender-based harassment during campaigns a ground for disqualification and an election offense.
""Ang mga bastos at mapanghamak na pananalita laban sa kababaihan ay hindi dapat maging kalakaran sa ating pulitika. Dapat may pananagutan ang mga kandidatong gumagamit ng plataporma upang magpalaganap ng diskriminasyon, lalo na sa kababaihan at LGBTQ (Lewd and demeaning remarks against women should not be normalized in politics. Candidates who use their platform to spread discrimination, especially against women and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people must be held accountable),"" Brosas said.
The bill defines election offenses to include ""public degradation, ridicule, and harassment"" of women and members of the LGBTQIA+ community in campaign-related activities, such as assemblies, interviews, sorties, and the release of online and print materials.
""This bill is not only a legal measure but a statement that women's dignity is non-negotiable in our political landscape,"" she said. ""We are sending a clear message that sexist remarks, objectification, and discriminatory behavior have no place in democratic discourse.""
In the bill's explanatory note, Brosas cited several high-profile incidents of misogyny in Philippine electoral campaigns.
Among them was then Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterteís controversial 2016 remark about an Australian rape victim, which drew widespread criticism from womenís groups.
More recently, the bill referenced Pasig congressional candidate Attorney Christian Sia, who faced backlash after a video showed him making sexually charged remarks about single mothers.
In the video, which has gone viral, Sia said single mothers who are still menstruating and lonely could sleep with him.
Sia later apologized, claiming the comment was meant as a joke to engage his audience while presenting his platform. (PNA)

According to Cabonegro, voters must allow these bets to prove themselves to hold public office.
ìMore than one-third na tumatakbo ngayon sa Senate ay relatively alternative or alternative talaga so maraming mapagpipilian. Bigyan lamang ng pagkakataon,î Cabonegro said in a forum.
The Commission on Elections (Comelec) released the partial list of senatorial candidates for the 2025 elections on Wednesday, and the list includes reelectionists, progressives, names from prominent political dynasties, and those gunning for a Senate comeback.
ìSa amin, fair game langÖ ilagay niyo kami sa debate kasama ng mga dose na ito at ibabagsak namin ëyang mga ëyan sa usapin lang ng agendaÖ Yun lang, mananalo na kami,î Cabonegro added.
(To us, itís a fair gameÖ Put us in debates alongside these 12, and weíll bring them down just through the agenda aloneÖ Thatís it and we will win.)
The Comelec previously said it is open to public debates before the 2025 elections. However, its chairman George Garcia said such debates must be organized by media entities, and the poll body would ìjust be there to supervise and coordinate with the candidates.î
The senatorial aspirant also said that candidatesí campaign funds should come from people who will vote for them.
ìNaniniwala kami na ang dapat na pumopondo sa mga tumatakbo ay ëyung mga gustong bumoto sa kanila, hindi ang kandidato,î Cabonegro stated.
(We believe that those funding the candidates should be the voters who want to support them, not the candidates themselves.)
Cabonegro, who also ran for Senate in the 2022 elections, shared that his supporters spent P120,000 for his campaign. He also said that he did not spend a single peso in financing his bid."

Out of 66 bets vying for 12 seats in the Senate, only 12 candidates participated in the event organized by the universityís The Republic ñ Department of Political Science and ABS-CBN News.
They were fisheries sector advocate Rommel Arambulo, environmentalist Roy Cabonegro, former Bayan Muna party list Rep. Teddy CasiÒo, ACT Teachers party list Rep. France Castro, climate action advocate David de Angelo, University of Santo Tomas professor and lawyer Angelo de Alban, labor leaders Leody de Guzman and Luke Espiritu, Valenzuela Rep. Eric Martinez, womenís rights advocate Liza Maza, peasant sector activist Danilo Ramos, and transport sector advocate Mar Valbuena.
De Guzman set the tone of the debate by calling on the young voters who packed the venue to reject candidates who represent ìpolitics of billionaires, politics of dynasties, and politics of plunderers.î
Espiritu also took potshots at President Marcos Jr. for belittling candidates who are not backed by money and big political machineries.
ìHe said we were just sent to the store to buy vinegar and ended up filing our candidacies. I dare Bongbong Marcos: If any of us here land in the Senate, we will tear down political dynasties. Heads of Marcos and Duterte senators will roll,î Espiritu said, earning applause from the audience.
De Alban, for his part, warned young voters that the coming election will determine much of the policies that will map their futures.
ìIf you allow political dynasties and traditional politics to keep control of government, where do you see yourselves five, ten, 15 years from now?î he asked.
De Alban also coined the term ìKuPolî (Kumag na Politiko) for senatorial bets who are running on popularity or name-recall alone without any experience in governance or track record in advocating for social justice.
ìKumagî is a Filipino colloquial term for a person who is useless and an imbecile.
ìVoters should boycott KuPols, those who run just because of name-recall even if they know nothing about issues and (are) clueless about legislative work,î he said.
Ramos, who is running on a pro-farmer and fisherfolks platform, urged Filipinos to know the other candidates, particularly those representing the poor and less represented sectors of the society.
ìDo no limit your choices to the camps of Kasamaan and Kadiliman (Evil and Darkness). We are the alternatives. We should not allow that the Senate chairperson of the Committee on Agriculture, Food, Environment, Natural Resources, and Agrarian Reform is someone who is a real estate developer,î he pointed out drawing guffaws and hoots from the audience.

Government urged to prioritize environment, renewable energy to lower electricity costs
April 13, 2025 ,

By Rodolfo Dacleson II
(April 13, 2025) ñ An environmental advocate argued that prioritizing the environment could lead to lower electricity costs and long-term economic sustainability.
Roy Cabonegro, whoís running for senator in the upcoming midterm elections, stressed that the prevailing belief that environmental protection leads to higher prices of goods and commodities is inaccurate.
ìKapag inuna mo ëyung ating kalikasan, bumababa ang presyo at gastusin natin at mas nagiging sustinable ang kakayanan nating kumita,î said Cabonegro on One Newsí ìAplikante.î
The average electricity rate is over P13 per kilowatt-hour, as of writing.
Cabonegro, whoís part of the Democratic Party of the Philippines and chairs environmental organization Makakalikasan, furthered that while investing in renewable energy is costly, the feed-in tariff (FiT) system exists to support its early-stage development if the government participates.
The FiT system was established under Republic Act No. 9513 to encourage investments in renewable energy. Fixed payments will be offered to qualified power producers.
ìKailangan mag-invest ang estado (sa renewable energy). Ngayon na naka-hands-off ang estado, hindi talaga mangyayari ëyan. Mababa ang ating ambition sa ating mga target,î added Cabonegro.
The push for transitioning to renewable energy in the Philippines has been continually stalled by the countryís reliance on coal, among several hindrances.
In 2023, the Philippines became the most coal-reliant country in Southeast Asia based on data from energy think tank Ember. Coal accounted for 61.9% of the countryís electricity generation.
Coal produces large quantities of carbon emissions, which are among the leading contributors to climate change.
The Philippine Energy Plan of the Department of Energy revealed that the country will still heavily rely on fossil fuels, including coal, until 2040.
ìMay mali sa polisiya ng ating renewable energy. But when you really understand what renewable energy is, murang kuryente ang ibig sabihin nito,î claimed Cabonegro.
During the Conference of the Parties 26 in 2021, the Philippines was among the over 40 countries that vowed to transition away from coal power."

As we reflect on our earlier statement, ìToward a Blue-Green Commune: Collaborative Stewardship for the West Philippine Sea,î we reiterate the urgency of adopting a shared stewardship approach to preserve our marine ecosystems for future generations.
During todayís episode of the Makakalikasan Partyís weekly ESTADO ng KALIKASAN at LIPUNAN (State of the Environment and Society) online broadcast, our top leadersóParty Chairperson Orland Ravanera, Party President Roy Cabonegro, and Party Secretary-General Rommel Ortegaódelved into pressing issues confronting ocean conservation. They highlighted the profound challenges posed by ocean acidification driven by global warming, escalating pollution from land-based sources, including chemical runoff from conventional farming, and the critical issue of over extraction of marine resources.
The continued exploitation of our oceansí natural resources not only threatens biodiversity but also fuels conflicts among nations with overlapping claims of sovereignty and sovereign rights. In this context, we call for a paradigm shift from territorial disputes to a collaborative framework that prioritizes the health of our marine environments over geopolitical interests.
During the Makakalikasan Kapehan, our forum on Green Governance and Eco Spirituality, participants explored the Filipino concept of ìNasasakupanîóthe scope of responsibility we assume as stewards of our territories. This notion is central to our vision of Green Governance and Eco Spirituality, emphasizing that our duty to protect the environment extends beyond national boundaries and into the realm of shared global responsibility.
Applying the concept of ìNasasakupanî to the West Philippine Sea, we advocate for an innovative approach to conflict resolution through cooperative stewardship. We propose a unique alternative formula that involves shared responsibility for the conservation and sustainable use of our common seas and oceans. This vision aligns with the principles of eco-spirituality, which call for a deep respect for nature and a recognition of our interconnectedness with all living beings.
In line with this, we urge the nations bordering the West Philippine Sea to come together in a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect. By adopting a shared stewardship model, we can ensure the preservation of our marine ecosystems, safeguard the livelihoods of coastal communities, and promote peace and stability in the region.
On this World Oceans Day, let us reaffirm our commitment to protecting our oceans and recognize that the health of our marine environments is integral to the well-being of our planet. The Makakalikasan ñ Nature Party Philippines stands ready to lead the way toward a future where the West Philippine Sea is a symbol of cooperative conservation and sustainable development."

Ang mga climate extremes pala, tulad ng heatwave, matinding tag-tuyot, sobrang malalakas na pag-ulan, ay nagreresulta sa mga landslides, tulad na lang ng nangyari kumakailan sa Maco, Davao de Oro.
Ayon kay Cabonegro, umabot na tayo sa point-of-no-return kung saan dapat na nating harapin na talagang nagbago na ang panahon at dapat na din nating baguhin ang ating mga panuntunan at polisiya pagdating sa pagharap sa mga sakunang may kinalaman sa climate extremes ó o iyong grabeng epekto ng climate change.
Kung noong una akala natin na kapag nagtanim tayo ng puno ligtas na tayo sa landslide, ngayon pala hindi na sapat ito. Ito ay sapagkat apektado na ng climate extreme ang integridad ng lupa sa ating mga kabundukan. Kung noong una, kapag bumuhos ang ulan ay kaya pang sipsipin ng mga puno ang sobrang tubig sa bundok. Ngayon, sa sobrang dami ng tubig na ibinubuhos ng mga ulan, hindi na ito kayang sipsipin ng mga puno kaya nagiging lugaw ang mga lupang kinakapitan ng mga ito.
Kumbaga, yung ulan na dapat pang-isang buwan lang, ibinuhos na lahat sa loob lang ng isang araw. Ang resulta, landslide tulad nitong sa Barangay Masala, Maco, Davao de Oro.
Ito na kumbaga ang new normal pagdating sa kalikasan: Climate extreme, sunod-sunod na El NiÒo at La NiÒa na dati ay dekada ang binibilang bago maulit, at pati na ang mga resulta nito na malalakas na ulan, malawakang pagbaha at pagguho ng lupa, super typhoon na may hatid na delubyo, at mga sakunang sa end of the world movie mo lang noon napapanood.
Kaya sang-ayon tayo dito sa adbokasiya ni Cabonegro na dapat umaksyon na ang gobyerno kontra climate change. Tama si Cabonegro na dapat seryosohin ng gobyerno ang pagtugon sa climate extreme sapagkat ito ay lumala na bilang isyung pampolitika. Buhay, kaligtasan at kinabukasan na ng mamamayan ang pinag-uusapan natin dito.
Marapat lang na pakinggan natin ang panawagan ni Cabonegro na dapat lahat ng LGU ay may Local Climate Change Action Plan upang hindi tayo maging bulag at sablay sa pagtugon sa mga problemang lilikhain pa nitong climate extremes sa hinaharap.
Huwag na natin hintaying abutin ng delubyo bago umaksiyon."
Allen Capuyan,"Allen Capuyan no longer NCIP chief, but still part of commission",12-Sep-23,https://www.abs-cbn.com/news/nation/2025/5/8/some-passengers-at-manila-north-port-travel-early-for-may-12-elections-1718,"MANILA - Retired colonel Allen Capuyan has stepped down from his position as chairperson of the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP), but he remains part of the commission as representative of Regions 11 and 13, according to newly appointed NCIP Chairperson Jennifer Sibug-Las.

Lawmakers sought commitment from Sibug-Las and other NCIP commissioners on their independence from Capuyan.

ìCan I have a commitment from you that you will be different from the previous chairman?î Zamboanga Sibugay 1st District Rep. Wilter Palma asked.

ìTo the commissioners who are here, can we also have a commitment that you would be independent and not beholden to the previous chair? Because he is still part of the commission. He might influence whatever decision,î he added.

ìItís a great privilege and a great honor to be serving the millions of indigenous peoples in the country, so whatever happened in the past that were not workable for the indigenous peoples, in my time, as a daughter of the late Datu Joseph Sibug, the first sectoral representative of the indigenous cultural communities, indigenous peoples in the 9th Congress, I would dedicate my life to make changes that would benefit and that would help the indigenous peoples reach for and achieve their dreams and aspirations to be fully, genuinely recognized and be empowered,î Sibug-Las replied.

ìI believe that as the chairperson of the agency, together with the other commissioners and as a collegial body, we will act according to our mandate, independently, and with no other influence that will affect the mandate that is given to us,î she added.

Other NCIP commissioners also gave their commitment to be independent and work for the best interest of indigenous peoples.

Last year, the House Committee on Appropriations deferred for a week the consideration of NCIPís budget due to Capuyanís alleged red-tagging of indigenous peoples and progressive groups.
Albay First District Rep. Edcel Lagman said the commission dabbled in activities that are not within its mandate, using its meager funds.
Capuyan wrote a letter to lawmakers to explain the matter. Capuyan was not present during Mondayís budget hearing due to a ìvery important travel to Koreaî.

The House panel terminated Monday night the deliberations on the proposed 2024 budget for the NCIP."

He has been primarily involved in intelligence work, serving as Intelligence Service Unit chief in Davao from 1997 to 2000 and chief of operations of the Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (ISAFP) thereafter.
On May 27, 2019, former colonel Allen Capuyan was appointed as the Chairperson of the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP). He has been primarily involved in intelligence work, serving as Intelligence Service Unit chief in Davao from 1997 to 2000 and chief of operations of the Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (ISAFP) thereafter. In March 2019, Capuyan was likewise named as executive director of the National Secretariat of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF).
ìThe appointment of Capuyan will add to the more than 60 former police and military officials in Duterteís Cabinet. The likes of Capuyan revel in the tradition of militarism and warmongering. He will operate NCIP as if it were still an intelligence-gathering unit ñ weaponizing the agencyís people and resources to co-opt, harass, displace, destroy, and deny indigenous communities of their right to development and self-determination. The NCIP has likewise never been the bastion for indigenous rights, but having Capuyan at its helm will completely steer the agency off course, at the expense of indigenous communities and in the interest of military operations and economic plunder,î said Karapatan secretary general Cristina Palabay.
Palabay emphasized that the continued appointment of former military and police officials is in keeping with the Duterte governmentís ëwhole-of-nationí approach, implemented alongside counterinsurgency program Oplan Kapayapaan.
ìPublic office has not been only capitalized for private gain, but also for military operations. This is blurring the lines between civilian and military functions and serves only to normalize an emerging dictatorship masked in a different, indirect form. Appointments like this must not slip public scrutiny as this is indicative of the executiveís use of its powers to blatantly install an undemocratic and militarist government,î explained Palabay.  
Palabay raised that indigenous communities are already facing worsening attacks. The Save our Schools Network reported that on May 27-29, 2019, elements of the 67th Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army (IBPA) encamped in civilian houses in Brgy. Mahan-ub and Brgy. Binondo, Baganga, Davao Oriental. Furthermore, teachers  from the Mindanao Interfaith Services Foundation, Inc. (MISFI) alleged that parents were being coerced and threatened to discourage the enrollment of their children in the said community school. The parents were further blackmailed of forfeiture from their 4Ps enrollment if their children will continue to study in MISFI.
ìThis kind of situation will be aggravated by Capuyan. He will support and exacerbate militarization in communities, attacks against indigenous schools and leaders, and red-tagging of indigenous organizations,î Palabay cautioned.
The Karapatan official also noted that Capuyanís record has been plagued with irregularities. Particularly during the Duterte government, Capuyanís name was tagged as among those involved in the smuggling of Php 6.4 billion worth of drugs into the country in May 2017, allegedly providing tariff codes to smugglers that enabled the latter to skip thorough inspection. Capuyan, who was then an official of the Manila International Airport Authority, resigned his post in March 2018. A month later, Duterte named Capuyan as the presidential adviser for indigenous peopleís concerns under the Office of the President on April 18, 2018.
ìCapuyan has powerful backers in the governmentís top echelon, shielding him from accountability. Back during former Gloria Arroyoís administration, he was allegedly involved in the wiretapping of those considered GMAís opposition. This is again a manifestation of the ongoing militarization of the bureaucracy ñ an insidious pretext of a looming dictatorship,î Palabay concluded.  "

MANILA, Philippines ñ Controversial retired colonel Allen Capuyan ñ a Duterte appointee who red-tagged indigenous peoples and progressive groups ñ has stepped down from his position as chairperson of the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP).
In a Facebook post, Capuyan thanked President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. for ìentrusting NCIPî to him until September 5.
Capuyan, who was appointed NCIP chief in June 2019 and served the Marcos administration until September 5, was replaced by Jennifer ìLimpayenî Sibug-Las, previously the ethnographic commissioner for Central Mindanao.
Leaving his post as NCIP chairman meant that Capuyan was also no longer part of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) executive committee ñ a job that goes with being NCIP chief.
Capuyan said in a Facebook post that he was also no longer the Cabinet Officer for Regional Development and Security (CORDS) for Caraga, a designation he held in the last few months of the Duterte administration and since July, under the Marcos administration.
In a Facebook post on September 7, Capuyan said, ìNow signing off as Chairperson, NCIP; as CORDS 13; Execom Member, NTF-ELCAC and SUCBEM Focal, NTF-ELCAC.î 
Capuyanís many controversies
When he was the Duterte administrationís NTF-ELCAC executive director, alternative media networks sued him over his red-tagging claims.
Capuyan was a divisive but persistent figure under Rodrigo Duterteís administration, which saw a proliferation of major civilian government posts going to retired armed forces personnel. In fact, his role as NCIP chairperson was his 4th appointment under Duterte. 
He first acted as Manila International Airport Authority assistant general manager for security and emergency services ñ a position he resigned from amid allegations of his involvement as the ìBig Brotherî in the P6.4-billion shabu smuggling incident. 
Capuyan also made veiled threats against Rappler and other alleged ìcommunistî groups after Rappler ran a story about the issues surrounding his appointment as NCIP chairperson.
Prior to this, Capuyan was identified as the alleged ìnumber one suspectî behind the wiretapping operations during the Arroyo administration, which eventually led to the ìHello Garciî controversy. (READ: From Hello Garci to ëBig Brotherí: Who is Allen Capuyan?) ñ Rappler.com"

MANILA, Philippines ñ Allen Capuyanís recent appointment as chairperson of the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) raised some eyebrows.
Yet again, President Rodrigo Duterte has chosen a retired military officer to head a civilian agency. And not just any agency but one which revolves around indigenous communities ñ a sector in society that has had its share of tense brushes with the armed forces.
But there are other issues. Is Capuyan qualified, given that an NCIP chairman must have proof that he or she comes from an IP group? Is tapping a former general with experience in fighting communist insurgency related to Duterteís own recent remarks about ìhamlettingî Lumads to ìprotectî them from the New Peopleís Army?
Letís tackle the issues surrounding Capuyanís appointment one by one.
1. Qualifications
The Implementing Rules and Regulations of the law that created the NCIP (Indigenous Peopleís Rights Act) states that the chairperson is chosen from a pool of 7 commissioners appointed by the President.
Commissioners, and thus the chairperson as well, should ìcome from one of the 7 ethnographic/cultural areas.î
The rules get more specific, stating they must be a ìbonafide member, by consanguinityî of an indigenous cultural community or indigenous peoples. This must be certified by their tribe, through the ìattestation of the Council of Elders, community leaders, or indigenous peoples organization.î
They are even required to submit their genealogy, to the 4th degree, which must have been certified by traditional leaders.
Then, they also need to present a sworn statement describing their experience in ethnic affairs with an IP community or government agency involved in IP concerns ìfor at least 10 years.î
Former presidential adviser on the peace process Jesus Dureza attested to Rappler that Capuyan is a ìmember of a tribe in Davao del Norte.î
He could not recall the exact name of the tribe but some news articles identify Capuyan as a Manobo.
Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea is yet to reply to Rapplerís query on Capuyanís membership in an IP group.
As to experience with IP affairs, Capuyan was appointed by Duterte as presidential adviser for indigenous peoples concerns in April 2018.
Dureza vouched for Capuyanís qualifications to lead the NCIP.
ìNo doubt he had long exposure and expertise on tribal matters,î he said, adding that he himself tapped Capuyan as a consultant back when he was Mindanao Development Authority chairperson during the Arroyo administration.
Capuyan was also a ìpro bonoî consultant for Dureza when he was Presidential Assistant for Mindanao during the Ramos presidency. At the time, Capuyan was still an active-duty soldier.
2. ëReign of terrorí
Part of Capuyanís experience in dealing with IPs while he was on active military duty was leading Task Force Gantangan where the AFP tapped Lumad leaders to help fight NPA rebels.
The task force, which was set up during the Arroyo administration, led to the formation of armed groups like Alamara and Magahat-Bagani which supposedly protected IP communities from the NPA.
But a Leftist IP group, Sandugo Movement of Moro and Indigenous Peoples for Self-Determination, claimed the task force killed Lumad leaders just opposing mining projects and agro-industrial projects in their ancestral lands.
Lumad is a term referring to IP groups in Mindanao.
Sandugo is fiercely contesting Capuyanís appointment to the NCIP, saying he played a major role in the ìreign of terrorî in Mindanao.
Sandugo also warned that Capuyanís indebtedness to Duterte means he would pave the way for Chinese-funded projects in IP ancestral lands.
ìAs NCIP chief, retired colonel Capuyan can easily coerce communities to approve a fake ëfree prior and informed consentí (FPIC) for the construction of the Chico River Water Pump Project in Pinukpok, Kalinga and the Kaliwa Dam Project in General Nakar, Quezon and Tanay, Rizal,î they said in a statement. 
FPIC refers to a document attested to by an indigenous peoples (IP) community that the consensus of all members was obtained without any external manipulation and is in accordance with their customary laws and practices. 
3. Duterteís top-of-mind IP concern
But it seems itís this type of experience that Duterte values in Capuyan. After all, his last government post before NCIP was as executive director in an anti-insurgency office created by Duterte.
Called the National Secretariat of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict, the office seeks to prevent, at the local level, people from joining the NPA.
Itís supposed to do this by ensuring the provision of social services, employment opportunities, and improved quality of life in communities affected by armed communist conflict.
Given the Presidentís past remarks, his main concern with the IPs is their vulnerability to being influenced by communists.
He once threatened to bomb Lumad schools for supposedly teaching Leftist ideology. He told Lumad leaders to prepare for relocation so he can better keep them away from the NPA. In December last year, he ìrefinedî this idea, suggesting he would ìhamletî indigenous peoples into areas guarded by the military and police.
Hamletting involves isolating people in villages known to have communist rebel presence or influence through forced relocation. Human rights groups have criticized the practice as making communities vulnerable to human rights abuses and harassment.
Hamletting is among the human rights violations committed under Ferdinand Marcosí Martial Law as documented by Task Force Detainees.
Dureza, back when he was Duterteís peace process adviser, had claimed that ì75%î of Lumad are recruited by the NPA.
Ever since he ended peace talks with the Left, Duterte has been hell-bent on cracking down on communists. He declared them terrorists and said his martial law in Mindanao is partly to rid the southern region of the NPA.
His advisers have asked international organizations like the European Union to stop funding groups they claim are backed by the Communist Party of the Philippines.
4. Who did Capuyan replace?
Capuyanís appointment means the departure of his predecessor, Leonor Oralde-Quintayo.
In January, the Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission (PACC) admitted it was investigating Quintayo for alleged corruption and complaints that she was neglecting to address concerns of a particular IP group.
ìThere are allegations against her by certain IP groups of Central Luzon about alleged violation of the requirement of free, prior, and informed consent and non-release of shares from locators to the IPs,î PACC commissioner Manny Luna told Rappler.
However, he does not want to assume that these complaints led to Quintayo getting replaced.
ìI can only surmise that the President wants a new leadership at NCIP. The appointment of Allen Capuyan is a welcome development for us in the PACC,î he said.
5. Another military appointee
The NCIP leadership is yet another civilian post that is now occupied by a retired military man. Capuyanís appointment calls to mind a similar appointment of former military chief Carlito Galvez Jr as Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process, a position that, like the NCIP chairmanship, has to do with the Left. Former army chief Rolando Bautista now leads the Department of Social Welfare and Development, an agency once at the helm of a Leftist, Judy Taguiwalo.
Based on Rapplerís tally, almost 50  major civilian government posts have been given to retired military or police by President Duterte.
Capuyan is from the Philippine Military Academy Class of 1983. His classmates include Interior Secretary Eduardo AÒo, National Irrigation Administration chief Ricardo Visaya, National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council Executive Director Ricardo Jalad, and resigned Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office general manager Alexander Balutan.
Capuyan became the chief for operations of the militaryís Intelligence Service in 2004, under the Arroyo administration. From 1997 to 2000, he was chief of Davao Cityís Intelligence Service Unit, which likely led him to meet Duterte.
6. Bureau of Customs controversy
Though his NCIP posting is already his 4th appointment under Duterte, Capuyan canít shake off the controversy from his first job at the Manila International Airport Authority ñ the P6.4-billion shabu smuggling incident. 
At the time the shabu was brought in, Capuyan was MIAA assistant general manager for security and emergency services. 
At congressional hearings, he was accused by customs broker Mark Taguba of providing him, via mail, tariff codes that were supposed to give Taguba access to the green lane or express lane, which exempts shipments from X-ray inspection. This is supposedly how Taguba was able to smuggle in shabu from China.
Taguba said Capuyan was the ìBig Brotherî in text messages wherein he was arranging the smuggling of contraband. (READ: From Hello Garci to ëBig Brotherí: Who is Allen Capuyan?)
The Mindanao Indigenous Peoples Council of Elders and Leaders (MIPCEL), in a statement meant to defend Capuyan, dismissed the shabu issue, saying Capuyan is yet to be convicted over it.
They also said Capuyan reported the smuggling to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, Department of Finance, and Department of Foreign Affairs.
The P6.4-billion shabu controversy also dragged in President Duterteís son Paolo who, Taguba said, was being name-dropped by certain Bureau of Customs officials involved in drug smuggling.
Like Capuyan, government personnel tagged by Taguba in the smuggling, were reappointed by Duterte, despite his avowed zero-tolerance for even ìone whiffî of corruption. These include former customs officials Nicanor Faeldon, Gerardo Gambala, Milo Maestreocampo, and Ariel Nepomuceno. ñ Rappler.com"
Allen Capuyan,Datu Makabulig Allen Arat Capuyan: A Life of Service and Dedication to Indigenous Peoples and the Nation,27-Feb-25,https://tuklasinnatin.net/2025/02/27/datu-makabulig-allen-arat-capuyan-a-life-of-service-and-dedication-to-indigenous-peoples-and-the-nation/,"In the heart of the Philippines, where verdant mountains meet the azure skies, lives a man whose legacy is etched not just in military valor but in the empowerment of Indigenous Peoples (IPs). Datu Makabulig Allen Arat Capuyanóa name that resonates with leadership, dedication, and unwavering commitment to the marginalized.
Roots of Heritage and Honor
Born with deep ancestral roots connecting him to the Manobo Tribe of Agusan del Sur and the Kankana-ey Tribe of the Cordillera, Datu Makabulig carries a lineage of culture and tradition that shaped his principles and purpose. He is not merely a product of his heritage; he is its champion, steadfast in his mission to uplift Indigenous Cultural Communities (ICCs) in the Philippines.
A Distinguished Military Career
Graduating from the prestigious Philippine Military Academy (PMA) ìMatikasî Class of 1983, Capuyanís journey began with honor and discipline. His military career was marked by excellence and dedication, serving in critical infantry and field duties, predominantly within the 1st Scout Ranger Regiment. From commanding the 16th Scout Ranger Company, where he initiated the Signal Intelligence Program of the AFP, to leading the 1st Scout Ranger Battalion, his leadership and strategic acumen were undeniable.
His role as Commander of Task Force ìGantanganî was particularly significant, as it involved deep mobilization within Indigenous Peoplesí Ancestral Domains in Mindanao, navigating the complexities of leadership amidst cultural sensitivities and insurgency challenges.
Mastering Intelligence and Strategic Operations
Capuyanís expertise extended beyond field operations to strategic intelligence. His roles as Task Group Panther2 Commander of the Scout Rangers, G2 of the 1st Scout Ranger Regiment, and Chief of the Operations & Intelligence Division (OID) at the Intelligence Service Armed Forces of the Philippines (ISAFP), showcased his mastery in intelligence management and strategic operations. His visionary approach contributed significantly to national security and operational effectiveness.
From Military Service to Public Service
Retiring early in 2010, Capuyan transitioned to public service, driven by his passion for uplifting Indigenous Peoples. His leadership journey continued as the OIC of the Mindanao Area Coordinating Center under the Office of the President-Mindanao (OPAMIN) and as the Knowledge Management Director of the Office of the Presidential Adviser for Special Concerns (OPASC).
Notably, he became the Assistant General Manager for Security and Emergency Services at the Manila International Airport Authority (2016-2017), ensuring safety and security in one of the countryís busiest airports.
His most impactful roles, however, were as the Presidential Adviser on Indigenous Peoples Concerns (OPAIPC, 2018-2019), Executive Director of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC, 2019-2022), and Chairperson of the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP, 2019-2023). Under his leadership, the NCIP became a vital ally to ICCs/IPs, advocating for their rights and development while countering insurgency influences in ancestral domains.
Championing Indigenous Peoplesí Rights
Datu Makabuligís dedication to IP rights is unparalleled. His leadership in NTF-ELCAC saw the strategic crafting of campaigns addressing insurgency while respecting indigenous cultural contexts. As NCIP Chairperson, he revitalized the agency, transforming it into a responsive partner for IPs, advocating for the full implementation of the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act of 1997 (RA 8371).
Opting to resign from public office on January 1, 2024, he chose to return to his rootsócontinuing his advocacy for Indigenous Peoples, a passion that led him to retire early from military service.
A Visionary Leader and Mentor
Today, Datu Makabulig Allen Arat Capuyan remains a cornerstone of Indigenous advocacy as Senior Adviser to pivotal organizations including:
Mindanao Indigenous Peoples Conference for Peace and Development (MIPCPD)
Mindanao Indigenous Peoples Council of Elders and Leaders (MIPCEL)
Epanaw Cultural Foundation
Ancestral Domain Management Systems Inc. (ADMSI)
Mindanao Indigenous Peoples Youth Organization (MIPYO)
Through these roles, he empowers the youth, strengthens ancestral domain governance, and promotes cultural preservation and economic development.
Legacy of Service and Advocacy
Datu Makabuligís life is a testament to his profound commitment to his people and his nation. A man of courage, vision, and compassion, he remains a beacon of leadershipóbridging tradition and modernity, advocacy and governance.
In a world that often overlooks the marginalized, Datu Makabulig Allen Arat Capuyan stands tall, carrying the legacy of his ancestors while forging a future of hope and empowerment for Indigenous Peoples. His journey continues, not just as a leader but as a symbol of resilience, integrity, and love for his people."
Allen Capuyan,"New NCIP head, a legitimate IP",8-Jun-19,https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1071853,"MANILA -- Newly-appointed National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) chairperson Allen Capuyan dismissed on Saturday news reports that cast doubts on his qualifications to lead the agency on claims that he is not a bonafide member of any IP group or indigenous cultural community (ICC).
In a statement, Capuyan said he is an IP by blood as he comes from the Manobo Tribe of Agusan Del Sur, contrary to some media reports which questioned his legitimacy as an IP member.
""I am an IP by blood from the Manobo Tribe of Agusan Del Sur,"" the NCIP head said.
He added that he has the lineage and certification to prove that he is a legitimate IP member as he even became a Commission of National Integration College Scholar prior his entry to the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) in 1979 and graduation in 1983.
The Commission of National Integration is the forerunner of NCIP.
In response to claims that Capuyan and his commissioners must ""come from one of the seven ethnographic/cultural areas"", the NCIP official said he went through this process to be selected as NCIP Ethnographic Region Commissioner for Regions 11 (Davao Region) and 13 (Caraga) last May 27.
Capuyan resigned as Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) assistant general manager for security and emergency services in April 2018 to heed President Rodrigo R. Duterte's request for him to join his brethrens from the ICCs and IPs and liberate them from poverty and terrorism caused by the communist terror groups (CTGs).
""I resigned from MIAA, heeding to a call from President Duterte sometime February 2018 when he told me, 'for the last time, as your patriotic duty and love of country, join your brethren ICCs/IPs and liberate them from poverty and terrorism by the CTGs,"" he added.
This led to his appointment as Presidential Adviser On Indigenous Peoples' concern, with the rank of Undersecretary in April 2018.
Despite not having any position connected to any agencies or offices related to IPs and ICCs, Capuyan said he served the Indigenous People Advocacy from 1999 to the present.
""I also served in the IP Advocacy from 1999 to 2019 but went fulltime from 2008-2015,"" he added.
He retired eight years ahead from the mandatory military retirement age of 56 in 2010 in line with efforts to help the IPs in Mindanao regarding their struggles.
Regarding his appointment as Executive Director of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF ELCAC) in March concurrent with his post and primacy as NCIP chair, Capuyan believes that this is due to the President's desire to have someone who will work hard to implement Republic Act No. 8371 or the Indigenous Peoples' Right Act (IPRA) of 1997.
""The wisdom I hold both position is the President desire to have a laser focus actions for the ICCs/IPs full implementation of the intent and spirit of IPRA,"" he added.
The NCIP chief believes that the IPRA law can be only be implemented to the fullest if the ICCs and IPs are liberated from their almost 50 years of infiltration, destruction, influence and control brought by the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army (CPP-NPA) and total exposure for the National Democratic Front (NDF) and and its allies who are behind the so-called revolutionary dual tactics, extortions, mass killing and corruption of the IP culture.
The CPP-NPA which is listed as a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the Philippines.
He also challenged the CPP-NPA and NDF to send representatives and witnesses to discuss every detail of the communist rebels' 17 major atrocities against the country's IPs for the last 50 years.
""Don't hide in your own propaganda machinery and organization. Just like Satan, you are in this world to steal, kill and destroy (and) trying to appear like an angel championing human rights,"" he added.
The time of reckoning for communist terrorists and their allies for crimes committed against the ICCs and IPs will come and will be revealed in due time, with the truth setting the country free, Capuyan said.
With the NTF ELCAC gaining momentum, thanks to the multitude of approaches, the government, as Department of Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin earlier said, now has a clear framework and basis for national convergence which they can even tell and expound to CPP founding chair Jose Maria ""Joma"" Sison to convince him to join and implement the plan, he said.
""Lastly the NTF ELCAC is taking off from the environment of whole-of-government, whole-of-nation (approach), enhanced good governance, pro-people and culture/human rights sensitive and more involvement of civilian agencies in the 12 lines of efforts/clusters with the AFP/PNP going back to its core competencies,"" he said.
The NTF ELCAC was created through Executive Order 70 signed by President Duterte on Dec. 4, 2018.
This provides for a whole-of-nation approach in defeating the local communist terrorist groups.
Earlier, the Mindanao Indigenous Peoples (IP) Council of Elders and Leaders (MIPCEL) said it will never support efforts to discredit Capuyan.
The group issued the statement Thursday following leftist group Sandugo's strongly-worded protest to the former military officer's appointment to the NCIP which was made public Tuesday.
""The appointment of Capuyan speaks loudly of the NTF (National Task Force) to End Local Communist Armed Conflict that in fact targets the Indigenous Peoples organizations and leaders. These attacks against us with Capuyan at the helm of the NCIP will further intensify as if we are the enemies. The appointment of another soldier in a civilian post shows that the Duterte government is mustering all its agencies against. This is the core of the 'Whole of Nation Approach' in the governmentís Oplan Kapayaan counter-insurgency program. These are instruments that Capuyan and Duterteís other military minions will use hand in hand with direct military actions,"" the group said.
MIPCEL claimed there is nothing original with the statement issued by Sandugo as it merely parroted it from Karapatan secretary general Cristina Palabay."
Allen Capuyan,The favored career of Allen Capuyan,30-Apr-18,https://opinion.inquirer.net/112820/favored-career-allen-capuyan,"Fortunate is the civil servant who gets embroiled in high-profile controversies and then gets absolved by way of presidential appointments, not just once but twice.
Allen Capuyan is living proof. His involvement in prominent debacles that took the public by storm makes for an interesting topic on accountability of public officials.
Let us trace his storied career.
Capuyan began his military vocation after graduating from the Philippine Military Academy in 1983.
In 2004, he was appointed chief for operations of the Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (ISAFP). A news commentary at the time identified him as the most powerful man in the agency.
Perhaps the portrayal was rational. A military source cited him in a 2005 report as the ìNo. 1 suspectî in a covert military wiretapping operation that went awry.
Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was the president then. It was presidential election season. The military operation was designed as a surveillance dragnet by monitoring phone conversations of opposition politicians suspected of colluding with Commission on Elections officials.
Article continues after this advertisement
Much to public delight, however, the reconnaissance turned serendipitous. The person caught in the wiretaps was no less than Arroyo herself who was recorded talking to Comelec commissioner Virgilio Garcillano about her own election tallies.
Despite the controversy that gravely demonized Arroyoís political career, Capuyanís career wasnít over as yet. In the 2010 elections, Abante Tribung Makabansa vied for party-list and its first nominee was Capuyan, in an election that saw several other former and active military officers in the running as representatives, all identified as allies of Arroyo.
Capuyanís telling epilogue came a year later. It was in 2011 that Capuyan was identified by Lt. Col. Pedro Sumayo Jr. of the ISAFPís Military Intelligence Group (MIG) 21 as the man behind the burning of the ìHello, Garciî tapes.
Article continues after this advertisement
Sumayo had testified that he had given the tapes to Capuyan who then ordered him to burn the recordings. Unknown to the two, however, Sumayoís subordinate Sgt. Vidal Doble made copies of the tapes. The rest is history.
But so too did Capuyan make history.
In the P6.4-billion shabu mess under President Duterte, Capuyanís phantom reappeared. Bureau of Customs fixer Mark Taguba identified Capuyan, who was then assistant general manager for security and emergency services of the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA), as the player codenamed ìBig Brother.î
Big Bother, Taguba testified in the Senate, provided tariff codes via e-mail that gave him access to the green express lane that exempted shipments from X-ray inspection. Capuyan resigned from his MIAA post last March.
But how lucky can he get. A month later, Mr. Duterte appointed him as presidential adviser for indigenous peoplesí concerns with the rank of undersecretary.
What is Capuyanís Duterte connection? From 1997 to 2000, he was chief of the Intelligence Service Unit in Davao City.
Capuyan is said to be a Manobo. In this day and age when ìpseudo-Manobosî like Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez prosper out of convenience, let us hope he is not doing an Alvarez.
It is not only Capuyanís controversial record that should bother us. His current appointment is almost always accompanied by vexing discourses from Jesus Dureza, Mr. Duterteís classmate who serves as presidential adviser on the peace process: ìSeventy-five percent of New Peopleís Army cadres is made up of indigenous peoples.î
What dirty tricks are being tasked to Allen Capuyan this time, given suspicion that he is proficient in obstruction of justice? That is on top of the fact that Mr. Duterte has shamelessly buried the P6.4-billion shabu mess ó for now ó but not after he leaves office. There is a time for reckoning. As it is for Mr. Duterte, Capuyanís day will come."
Allen Capuyan,Teddy CasiÒo reiterates call for end of political dynasties,27-Jan-25,https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/934197/teddy-casi-o-reiterates-call-for-end-of-political-dynasties/story/,"Former Bayan Muna party-list representative Teddy CasiÒo on Monday reiterated his call for the end of political dynasties as he pushed for democratic governance in the country.

Interviewed over Super Radyo dzBBís Ikaw Na Ba? The Senatorial Interviews, CasiÒo said the prohibition of political dynasties should be a peopleís movement.

ìSa demokrasya, we are a government for the people of the people by the people. Hindi nangyayari 'yan sa Pilipinas. We are a government of the rich by the political dynasties by the corrupt politicians,î said CasiÒo.

*Under democracy, we are a government for the people of the people by the people. But thatís not whatís happening. We are a government of the rich by the political dynasties by the corrupt politicians.)

ìNumber one d'yan, ëyung pagwawakas ng political dynasties. Nasa Constitution naman 'yan, kailangan lang talaga na may magtutulak sa Senado. Hindi lang sa Senado, kundi sa labas ng Senado. It has to be a peopleís movement,î he said. 


(The number one solution is to end political dynasties. That is under the Constitution, we just need someone to push it in the Senate. Not just the Senate but outside it. It has to be a peopleís movement.)

Section 26 of Article II of the 1987 Constitution states that: ""The State shall guarantee equal access to opportunities for public service and prohibit political dynasties as may be defined by law.

However, there is now law yet defining political dynasties. Several proposed measures have been filed in the past to stop political dynasties but lawmakers have yet to agree on its definition.

CasiÒo, adding that informed citizens are necessary for democratic governance, said the proposed Freedom of Information (FOI) Bill should be finally passed into law.

ìAng mga mamamayan natin ay hindi makapag-participate kasi hindi nila alam kung ano ang mga nangyayari talaga. Ang FOI long overdue ëyan, kailangan natin ipasa,î he added. 

(Filipinos cannot participate in governance because they do not know what is happening. We need to pass the long overdue FOI Bill.)

The ex-lawmaker is also pushing for the revival of the Land Reform Act for farmers, strengthening the basic education system, removing confidential and intelligence funds in civilian agencies, free healthcare program, and legislated wage hike. 

CasiÒo is running under the senatorial slate of Houseís Makabayan bloc, joining ACT-Teachers Party-list Rep. France Castro, Gabriela Party-list Rep. Arlene Brosas, Kilusang Mayo Uno secretary general Jerome Adonis, former National Anti-Poverty Commission lead convenor Liza Maza, and Pamalakaya secretary general Ronnel Arambulo.óAOL, GMA Integrated News"
Allen Capuyan,"Teddy CasiÒo: Moderate, do not muzzle social media",24-Mar-25,https://malaya.com.ph/news/national-news/teddy-casino-moderate-do-not-muzzle-social-media/,"BAGONG Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan) chairperson and senatorial aspirant Teddy CasiÒo yesterday voiced reservations about calls for the government to go tough on social media vloggers who are being investigated in Congress for abetting disinformation and targeting persons and government institutions online.
In an opinion posted on his official Facebook page, the former Bayan Muna congressman noted that the House tri-committeeís inquiry has revealed the possible involvement of a foreign government in the spread of fake news and proposals to impose restrictions on social media contents.
ìThe recent House inquiry on disinformation has exposed a troubling reality. While it did recognize the accountability of some so-called DDS vloggers in spreading fake news, it also revealed several complications, like Chinaís hand in the matter and proposals to regulate social media,î he said.
CasiÒo, a writer and human rights activist, noted that based on the disclosures elicited from pro-Duterte vloggers, some social media personalities with big numbers of followers appear to have been tapped by China to shape public discourse and perception.
ìThe responses given indicate how pervasive our countryís problem on disinformation has become. Beyond spreading lies and biased narratives, it seems some vloggers have allowed themselves to be used by China to promote disinformation specifically regarding our claim to the West Philippine Sea,î he pointed out.
During the tri-comm hearing, some pro-Duterte vloggers including former presidential communications office secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles admitted that China had sponsored seminars abroad that took up to 12 days.
One of them, Mark Anthony Lopez, admitted to posting a fabricated assertion that Philippine Coast Guard vessels have used water cannons against Chinese ships and personal attacks against PCG Commodore Jay Tarriela.
While agreeing that the admissions were serious, CasiÒo insisted that regulation of free speech and expression is never a solution to  disinformation.
ìWhile we believe that those spreading lies and disinformation should be held liableÖ we cannot resort to gagging them as this runs counter to the Constitution which guarantees freedom of thought and expression. The government should especially be careful not to use its vast powers to intimidate people into silence,î he said.
He also said Congress has to exercise temperance in trying to strike a balance in upholding the freedom of speech and of expression while ensuring accountability for harmful behavior on social media platforms.
ìPropagating the truth is still the best way to fight disinformation. Perhaps we can start by allowing journalists to practice their code of ethics freely and without fear. We should also pass the long overdue right to information law. Plus we can strengthen public and private fact-checking mechanisms to counter false information,î he said."
Teddy CasiÒo,"Challenging traditional politics, former Bayan Muna solon to run for the Senate",21-Aug-24,https://www.bulatlat.org/2024/08/21/challenging-traditional-politics-former-bayan-muna-solon-to-run-for-the-senate/,"MANILA ó Former Bayan Muna Rep. Teddy CasiÒo announced his senatorial bid for 2025 midterm elections in a short program at the Bantayog ng mga Bayani.
ìI wholeheartedly accept the challenge of the Makabayan coalition for the upcoming election. For the second time, I will run (for) senator,î CasiÒo said on Wednesday, August 21, coinciding with the date of the assasination of former opposition Senator Benigno Aquino Jr.
The timing of the announcement is significant for CasiÒo. During the Marcos Sr. dictatorship, he served as a volunteer for the National Movement for Free Elections (Namfrel) when he was still in high school, and took part in the 1986 People Power uprising.
Incidentally, CasiÒoís declaration happened a day after the administration disclosed its Senatorial slate, which is composed of traditional politicians from the ruling elite.
He is a long time activist, writer, and served as a partylist representative of Bayan Muna from 2004 to 2013.

Early this year, he was elected as chairperson of Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan), an alliance of progressive groups in the Philippines.
ìOne of my aspirations is for ordinary folk to be free from the food crisis and from poverty. They should receive higher wages from industries we can call our own. When this is finally materialised, our fellow Filipinos will no longer have to work abroad where they are subjected to slave-like conditions,î he said.
CasiÒo will also work towards holding human rights violators accountable such as former President Rodrigo Duterte, National Security Adviser Eduardo AÒo, and Ferdinand Marcos Jr., to name a few.

Heidi Roja, a supporter of Bayan Muna, said she has high hopes that CasiÒoís program will help them in the long run.
Roja is among those who attended the program at the Bantayog ng Bayani.
ìI do not see anything wrong with him. We are tired of hearing promises (from traditional politicians). That is why I hope that (CasiÒo) will be true to his promises,î she told Bulatlat.
CasiÒo said that the Philippine Senate is in dire need of a new set of faces who understand the real situation of the people.
ìThe candidates of Makabayan are sincere people. They came from the ranks of farmers, workers, teachers, and professionals who have shared experiences with ordinary folk,î CasiÒo said.
He is the sixth candidate from the Makabayan bloc to declare his candidacy."
Teddy CasiÒo,"VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Teddy CasiÒo, Renato Reyes NOT arrested by police",,https://verafiles.org/articles/vera-files-fact-check-teddy-casino-renato-reyes-not-arrested-by-police,"A video on YouTube claims that former Bayan Muna Rep. Teodoro ìTeddyî CasiÒo and BAYAN secretary-general Renato Reyes Jr., outspoken critics of President Ferdinand ìBongbongî Marcos, have been apprehended by the Philippine National Police (PNP). This is not true.
On Oct. 4, the video appeared with the false headline:

Showing photos of the alleged arrest of CasiÒo and Reyes, the narrator in the video said the police and the military have ordered the arrest of the two men who are supposedly profiting from protests.
The rest of the 27-minute video shows a spliced clip taken from two episodes of SMNI Newsí Laban Kasama ang Bayan program, where its hosts discussed whether the PNP can file a case against certain protesters.
The video offered no evidence to back its untrue claim. The photos of CasiÒo and Reyes shown in the video were taken years ago.

In an Oct. 6 email to VERA Files Fact Check, CasiÒo has denied that he was recently arrested. ìNot true. Iím actually in a meeting right now, free as a bird,î he said.
Meanwhile, Reyes said in a message to VERA Files: ìNo truth of course.î
He remains active on his official social media accounts where, as of Oct. 6 at 8:14 a.m., he tweeted about receiving death threats online over his anti-Marcos stance and his thoughts on the first 100 days of the president.
The photo of CasiÒoís ìarrestî was taken during the 2014 World Economic Forum Asia in Makati, as police apprehended him during a demonstration where protesters criticized the administration of late president Benigno Aquino III.
On the other hand, the photo of Reyes only shows him drinking a beverage, which appears to have been taken during a 2015 ìpeopleís hearingî on the Mamasapano clash. He is shown sporting the same clothes, bag strap and hairstyle in an ANC interview regarding the issue.
The circulating false video appeared days after critics, including CasiÒo and Reyes, slammed Marcos for attending the Formula One Grand Prix in Singapore while thousands of Filipinos were devastated by a recent typhoon.
YouTube channel VIRAL BALITA TV (created on June 12, 2021) published the incorrect video that garnered over 238,000 views and 6,500 interactions."
Teddy CasiÒo,Teddy CasiÒo: Street parliamentarian,4-Apr-13,https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2013/04/04/926712/teddy-casio-street-parliamentarian,"MANILA, Philippines - Bayan Muna party-list Rep. Teddy Casi√±o counts his 15 years as a street parliamentarian as part of his 23 years in public service, which he says greatly helped him in becoming an effective legislator and advocate for various pro-poor causes.
It‚Äôs his second attempt to become senator this May and despite his relatively low rankings in surveys, he remains unfazed.
‚ÄúI think history and public sentiment are on our side this time,‚Äù he says, noting there are less critics and cynics to his candidacy now.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve accepted the fact that the big names, famous surnames‚Äôand those with so much money and support for TV ads have the advantage, but I was never in politics just for the sake of winning, but for our advocacies,‚Äù he says.
Having established a strong track record, he says people are now asking him if he has the finances and other resources to wage a campaign. 
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no more question on our legitimacy, platform, and politics; the questions I‚Äôm asked now are more on the practical side. But I tell them, this candidacy is not about me. It‚Äôs about you and the kind of representation you want in the Senate,‚Äù Casi√±o says.
The third of five siblings, Casi√±o was born in Davao City on Nov. 15, 1968 to Amador Casareo Casi√±o, a lawyer from the University of the Philippines, and Lizabelle Icamina Acevedo of Kalibo, Aklan, who graduated from the Philippine Women‚Äôs University.
He took up AB Sociology at the UP Los Ba√±os where he was editor-in-chief of the UPLB Perspective and became national president of the College Editors Guild of the Philippines. Currently he is chairman of the committee on small business and entrepreneurship development in the House of Representatives, and executive vice president of the Makabayang Koalisyong ng Mamamayan (Makabayan).
He is married to Ruth Cervantes, a human rights advocate, and they have two young boys. He was an altar boy and wanted to be a priest, but in the process of fighting for social justice, lower prices of basic commodities, better pay for workers, and human rights in the streets, Casi√±o found himself in politics, as party-list congressman for the last eight years.
In the House, Casi√±o was principal author of 178 measures, including the Whistleblowers‚Äô Protection and Rewards Bill, Freedom of Information Bill, the Anti-Dynasty Bill, and the Anti-Epal Bill. Some became laws, including the Public Attorneys Act of 2007, the Tax Relief Act of 2009, Rent Control Act of 2009, and the Anti-Torture Act of 2009. What‚Äôs very clear to him, Casi√±o says, is the legislative anti-poverty agenda he will push in the Senate once elected.
He says he will push for the enactment of a law to ensure land, equipment, subsidies and other forms of support for farmers under agrarian reform to lift them from poverty and attain food security He will also seek the passage of law to develop and strengthen local industries ‚Äì from small enterprises to big factories to create adequate jobs and provide living wages to Filipino workers.
‚ÄúI will oppose the privatization of public hospitals, water districts, power generation, and other social services,‚Äù he says."

ìWhen climate justice is absent from platforms, it shows a dangerous disregard for the crises deepening hunger, worsening health, and driving poverty,î Lea B. Guerrero, country director at Greenpeace Philippines, said in the statement.

The candidates who responded to the survey were Leodegerio ìKa Leodyî De Guzman, Renecio ìLukeî S. Espiritu, Jr., Teodoro ìTeddyî A. CasiÒo, Jocelyn S. Andamo, Modesto ìModyî T. Floranda, David Delano DíAngelo, Norman C. Marquez and Arnel Bondilles Escobal.
But Greenpeace cited ìprevious positive efforts and track recordsî by nonrespondents like former Senators Francis Pancratius ìKikoî N. Pangilinan, who is cited for the Sagip Saka Act and legislative efforts to address single-use plastics, and Gringo N. Honasan for authoring the Clean Air Act and Solid Waste Management Act. 
The Sagip Saka Act empowered local governments to buy rice, vegetable and poultry for their feeding and relief programs directly from farmersí groups without the need for bidding.
ìWhile Filipinos grapple with climate disasters, plastic pollution and biodiversity collapse, our politicians cling and aspire to power through dynastic politics, smear campaigns and empty theatrics,î said Von Hernandez, Global Coordinator of the Break Free from Plastic movement.
Greenpeace said the state of the Philippine environment is ìregressing,î citing the push for nuclear energy and waste-to-energy facilities.
It also cited the proliferation of single-use plastics, which the government had planned to tax, and attempts to open municipal fishing waters to commercial fishing interests.
The group urged policymakers to support a proposed ban on single-use plastics and institutionalize reuse and zero-waste solutions.
They should also reject ìfalse fixesî like waste-to-energy incineration and nuclear energy, and push measures that would protect and rehabilitate the countryís terrestrial, coastal and marine resources, it added.
ìOur communities are drowning in plastic, our coastlines are eroding, and our children are growing up in a world where clean water and safe food are no longer guaranteed,î said Wes Lipana, marine litter management officer at Ecowaste Coalition.
ìOur environment is in a state of emergency, and that demands leadership,î he said. ìVoters must demand bold environmental leadership and scrutinize candidate track records, not slogans.î
A World Bank report in 2022 showed that climate change could cut the Philippinesí gross domestic product by as much as 13.6% by 2040.
It said ìadapting to the risks of climate change, including extreme events and slow-onset problems, is critical for the Philippines.î ìIt cannot wholly eliminate the costs of climate change, but it can greatly reduce them.î ó Kyle Aristophere T. Atienza"
Kiko Pangilinan,Surprise endorsement: Cebu gov backs Kiko Pangilinan for senator,45785,https://www.inquirer.net/440332/surprise-endorsement-cebu-gov-backs-kiko-pangilinan-for-senator/,"MANILA, Philippines ?With just days to go before the May 12 elections, former Sen. Francis ?iko?Pangilinan? comeback bid has gotten a much-needed boost from Cebu Gov. Gwendolyn Garcia, whose political machinery and influence command the province? 3.4 million votes.

During Pangilinan? visit to Cebu for a sortie on May 6, Garcia expressed her support for the senatorial candidate who is running under the opposition Liberal Party, saying her decision was rooted in their long-standing friendship.

?e really went out of his way to greet me and to say, ?ello, how are you, give my regards to [your brother] Pablo John.?I was so touched by that gesture,?Garcia said during a gathering of barangay chairs and mayors from the province? fifth and sixth districts. ?his really shows you what kind of person he is.?
?onstancy and consistency, that is the mark of true friendship. That is the mark of a true person,?she added.

Pangilinan, who is running on an agricultural platform, thanked Garcia and said that ?hile we don? have a strong political machinery, we?e hoping that we can count on you as our machinery, with your help and support.?
Garcia? endorsement came as a surprise, as it makes Pangilinan the only non-Alyansa para sa Bagong Pilipinas senatorial aspirant to get her backing.

Her political party, 1-Cebu, has endorsed all but one of the administration coalition? 11 contenders for the Senate.

? already said that 1-Cebu may support only nine or 10 [senatorial candidates], and you will know later who is the 11th,?Garcia said, referring to Pangilinan. ?he 12th is open; you can decide [who to vote for].?
The endorsement of Garcia, who has defied a six-month suspension order from the Office of the Ombudsman over a permit issued to a construction firm without an environmental clearance, is a big boost for any candidate.

In the 2022 national elections, the province? leaders, including Garcia, backed the ?niTeam?tandem of then former Sen. Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Vice President Sara Duterte, delivering a landslide win for them in Cebu.

In the past three months, Pangilinan and fellow opposition candidate Paolo Benigno Aquino IV have received the support of administration-allied government officials, which could bolster their chances of making it into the ?agic 12?this May 12."

?anggang sa Sabado tuluy-tuloy ang pangungumbinsi, mag-house-to-house pa rin, gumawa pa rin ng palengke visits, tawagan ang mga kaibigan, kaklase at kamag-anak. Mag-upload sa social media kung bakit niyo sinusuportahan ang ating kandidatura at i-share sa iba. Sabi ko nga, it? a tight race and every vote will count,?he added.

?ng ating gobyerno pati ang pamahalaang lokal sa bawat region, sa bawat lalawigan ay ipatutupad ito. Mag-iiba ang hugis ng agrikultura at pangingisda sa bansa. Bakit? Dahil sa batas na ito, pag bibili ang gobyerno direkta sa magsasaka at mangingisda, wala nang public bidding, at exempted sa procurement law,?he said.

Pangilinan capped his day with a visit to Dagupan, Pangasinan, to meet with volunteers and supporters.

Last-minute push for victory
The following day of Pangilinan? Ilocos leg campaign sortie, the former senator believes that a last-minute push for his candidacy will win him a coveted Senate seat in next week? polls.

Speaking on a pick-up truck that turned into a makeshift stage in front of the Ilocos Sur Provincial Capitol on Thursday, May 8, the former senator explained how some 20 percent of voters will decide who to vote for on Election Day itself.

?alang bibitiw. Tuloy-tuloy ang pagkukumbinsi. Sa totoo lang, base rin sa research hanggang 20% po ng botante hanggang sa araw ng halalan hindi pa magde-decide. Doon na lang sa araw ng halalan sasabihin, ?eka nga muna, sino nga ba ang ating senador???he said.

?aya kinakailangan puntahan pa sila, mag-marites na wag maniwala sa kasinungalingan. Doon lamang sa katotohanan,?he added.

With only two days left to the campaign period, Pangilinan will be barnstorming northern Luzon today, with his first stop in Ilocos Sur, where he said he won in the last three times he ran as senator.

?ito hanggang walo ang naglalabanan sa huling tatlo o apat na slot kaya sabi nga nila, it? neck-and-neck at dahil neck-and-neck, pwe-pwede pa ba na tuloy-tuloy pa natin ?ung pagkukumbinsi dito sa Vigan, dito sa Ilocos Sur?,?he asked his supporters.

Running on the platform of food security and lower prices of food, the former senator plans to further intensify his campaign in the remaining days to Election Day."
Ariel Porfirio Querubin,"Ariel Querubin urges unity, dialogue amid Marcos-Duterte rift: No progress if we keep fighting",45665,https://politiko.com.ph/2025/01/08/ariel-querubin-urges-unity-dialogue-amid-marcos-duterte-rift-no-progress-if-we-keep-fighting/headlines/,"Former Marine Colonel Ariel Querubin, a Medal of Valor awardee and senatorial aspirant, has called for unity and dialogue amid the feud of President Ferdinand ?ongbong?Marcos Jr. and Vice President Sara Duterte.

In an interview on Bilyonaryo News Channel? ?t the Forefront?hosted by Atty. Karen Jimeno, Querubin urged the two leaders to sit down and settle their differences.

?hy can? we all sit down, talk, and settle? If we continue fighting each other, we will never progress,?he said, naming corruption and other systemic issues as areas that deserve more attention than political infighting.

Querubin also pushed for nonpartisanship within the military amid the conflict between the country? top two leaders.

He reflected on the devastating impact of division within the armed forces.

Recalling past military confrontations, Querubin shared stories of soldiers fighting each other, often unaware of the personal connections they shared.

He cited a case where a soldier who was awarded the Medal of Valor destroyed a tank, only to later discover his own sibling was inside.

?he animosity created from soldiers fighting each other took years to heal,?Querubin said, adding that the emotional scars remain traumatic for many.

Querubin pointed out that the military must remain neutral and nonpartisan by citing his own dismissal as brigade commander in Marawi in 2004 after he had questioned the legitimacy of a sitting president when his men were allegedly ordered to manipulate election results.

?he armed forces should always be neutral, nonpartisan,?he reiterated.

As he campaigns for a Senate seat, Querubin stressed that his past experiences have shaped his belief in dialogue and reconciliation.

?ur politics has become toxic and divisive,?he said. ?e need to focus on what truly matters?nding conflict, promoting accountability, and ensuring progress for our nation.?
On the calls to abolish the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict, Querubin voiced strong support for continuing the NTF-ELCAC, describing it as a vital tool in weakening the communist insurgency.

?hen it was introduced, the communist movement significantly weakened,?he said.

Querubin noted that a purely military solution is insufficient by advocating for a whole-of-nation approach to address the roots of rebellion.

He warned that discontinuing NTF-ELCAC could reverse progress: ?f we remove it now, the insurgency might regain strength.?
Querubin? military career has been marked by distinction and controversy.

As a recipient of the Philippine Medal of Valor, the highest military honor, he was recognized for his bravery during a fierce battle against the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in Lanao del Norte in 2000.

However, he also gained notoriety for his involvement in the 2006 Marine standoff, a protest against alleged corruption and electoral fraud under President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.

Charged with mutiny, Querubin maintained that his actions were driven by a commitment to institutional reform and democratic principles.

He was granted amnesty in 2010, enabling him to return to civilian life."

During GMA? Tanong ng Bayan: The GMA Senatorial Face-off 2025, the senatorial aspirant was asked if such uprisings could be justified despite civilians being hurt.?
?a akin, paninindigan kasi nagawa natin yung mga, yung sinamahan natin, ang tawag ko dyan, military exercise. Kung saan, nanindigan ako na dapat itama yung pamamalakad ng gobyerno at lumaban ako sa korapsyon,?said Querubin.?
(For me, I stood for what I believed in when I joined the plot and I call it a military exercise. I stood for what I believed in, to correct how the government is being run and I fought against corruption.)?
?ung tanong ninyo kung meron ako pinagsisisihan dito, I have no regrets, but I have bitter lessons about this,?he added. ?t ?an ang gusto ko na isulong ngayon dahil naniniwala ako na ang kailangan natin isang matapang na senador na lumalaban against corruption at naninindigan para sa kapakanan ng taong bayan.?"
